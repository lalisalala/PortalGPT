            "summary": "This table shows the average House Price/Earnings ratio, which is an important indicator of housing affordability. Ratios are calculated by dividing house price by the median earnings of a borough.\nThe Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) is based on a 1 per cent sample of employee jobs. Information on earnings and hours is obtained in confidence from employers. It does not cover the self-employed nor does it cover employees not paid during the reference period. Information is as at April each year. The statistics used are workplace based full-time individual earnings.\nPre-2013 Land Registry housing data are for the first half of the year only, so that they are comparable to the ASHE data which are as at April. This is no longer the case from 2013 onwards as this data uses house price data from the ONS House Price Statistics for Small Areas statistical release. Prior to 2006 data are not available for Inner and Outer London.\nThe lowest 25 per cent of prices are below the lower quartile; the highest 75 per cent are above the lower quartile. The \"lower quartile\" property price/income is determined by ranking all property prices/incomes in ascending order. The 'median' property price/income is determined by ranking all property prices/incomes in ascending order. The point at which one half of the values are above and one half are below is the median.\nRegional data has not been published by DCLG since 2012. Data for regions has been calculated by the GLA. Data since 2014 has been calculated by the GLA using Land Registry house prices and ONS Earnings data.\nLink to DCLG Live Tables\nAn interactive map showing the affordability ratios by local authority for 2013, 2014 and 2015 is also available.",

            "summary": "FOCUSONLONDON2010:INCOMEANDSPENDINGATHOME\n\nHousehold income in London far exceeds that of any other region in the UK. At £900 per week, London’s gross weekly household income is 15 per cent higher than the next highest region. Despite this, the costs to each household are also higher in the capital. Londoners pay a greater amount of their income in tax and national insurance than the UK average as well as footing a higher bill for housing and everyday necessities. All of which leaves London households less well off than the headline figures suggest.\n\nThis chapter, authored by Richard Walker in the GLA Intelligence Unit, begins with an analysis of income at both individual and household level, before discussing the distribution and sources of income. This is followed by a look at wealth and borrowing and finally, focuses on expenditure including an insight to the cost of housing in London, compared with other regions in the UK.\n\nSee other reports from this Focus on London series.\n\nREPORT:\n\nTo view the report online click on the image below.\n   Income and Spending Report PDF\n\n\n\nPRESENTATION:\n\nThis interactive presentation finds the answer to the question, who really is better off, an average London or UK household?

            "summary": "This house price per square metre dataset is created through complex address-based matching between the Land Registry’s Price Paid Data (LR-PPD) and property size information from the Domestic Energy Performance Certificates (EPC) data published by the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC, formerly MHCLG). Details of the data linkage are published in the UCL Open: Environment along with the related linkage code via the UK Data Service ReShare repository.\nDuring this data linkage process, the transactions assigned as category B (Additional Price Paid entry) and other property types are removed. Here we publish our latest limited attribute version of the uncorrected house price per square metre dataset in England and Wales with the LR-PPD data (1/1/1995-26/2/2021) and Domestic EPCs data (the sixth version, up to 20/9/2020) downloaded on 1/4/2021 for non-commercial purpose. This uncorrected version of house price per square metre dataset records over 18 million transactions with 16 variables in England and Wales since 1995. Unlike in our published article, in this uncorrected version we have not removed transactions with any improbable price per square metre values - i.e. where either the transaction price or total floor area values are null, 0 or too low to be realistic. This uncorrected version of the data will offer the most flexibility for researchers.\nWe offer technical validation and data cleaning code via the UKDA ReShare repository to help users evaluate the representation of the linked data for a given time period. The data cleaning code shows our methods for cleaning up unlikely floor size records before using this data in analysis. Users can create their own rules and undertake this clean-up process based on their own experience and research aims.\nThis limited attribute version is published by local authority (2021 version). Details of the 16 variables are described in the explanation file. The National Statistics Postcode Lookup NSPL (May 2021 version) is used to assign the local authority unit for your production of area-based statistics. Users can match historical changes in LA boundaries by choosing appropriate aggregations using, for instance ONSPD, and the postcode variable in our dataset.\nAn extended version of this dataset containing additional variables is available from UK Data Service Reshare service. Users can directly access this full version dataset (tranall_link_01042021.zip) via the following link:  https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/855033/ . Accompanying LR-PPD and EPC data are also supplied through the ReShare service. Users who would like to attach their own additional variables from the LR-PPD data are advised to use the transactionid variable to link to the LR-PPD (LRPPD_01042021.zip). Users who would like to attach additional variables from the EPC data are advised to use the id variable to link to the sixth version Domestic EPCs (epc6_id.zip). \n\nThe 2024 update\n\n\nThe 2024 updated version of the house price per square metre dataset extends the data coverage to the end of 2024 (\nhpm_la_2024.zip\n). This new version is the result of linking LR-PPD data (01/01/1995–31/10/2024) and Domestic EPCs data (up to 31/10/2024), downloaded on 26/12/2024 for non-commercial purposes. It records over 22 million transactions in England and Wales since 1995.\n\n\nUnlike the previous versions, this updated removes the id variable (created by the authors) and adds the lmk_key variable (originally from the Domestic EPCs dataset). This change was made because the lmk_key serves as a unique identifier with no duplicate records since 2024.\n\n\nThe match rate of the linked data varies over time; therefore, we recommend users carefully choose the time coverage and validate the data coverage using the match rate. Please note that publicly available Domestic EPCs data starts in 2008, resulting in an extremely low match rate for the period between 1995 and 2008.\n\n\nThe National Statistics Postcode Lookup (November 2024 version) is used to assign local authorities (2023 version) for this publication. An extended version of this dataset, containing additional variables from LR-PPD and Domestic EPCs, will be available from the UK Data Service Reshare platform.\n\n\nAlternatively, users can use the lmk_key variable to link additional variables from the Domestic EPCs dataset or use the transactionid to add in other information from the LR-PPD dataset.\n\n\nThe 2023 update\n\n\n In 2023, a third updated version of the house price per square metre dataset has been published on the London Datastore ( hpm_la_2023.zip ). This new version extends the data coverage to 2023, but keeps the same publication format as the first publication. The new version is the linked result based on LR-PPD data (1/1/1995-31/10/2023) and Domestic EPCs data (end with 31/10/2023) downloaded on 2/12/2023 for non-commercial purposes. This uncorrected version of the house price per square metre dataset records almost 21 million transactions in England and Wales since 1995.\nThe match rate of this linked data varies across time, thus we suggest the user chooses the time coverage needed based on their own research. The id variable has been newly generated for this new version of the Domestic EPC dataset published by DLUHC at the end of the 2023, so it is not the same as the id variable in our previous publication( hpm_la.zip   or    hpm_la_2022.zip ) and should not be used to link between the new and the previous publication.\n\n The National Statistics Postcode Lookup NSPL (November 2023 version) is used to assign the local authority unit for this second publication. An extended version of this dataset containing additional variables from LR-PPD and Domestic EPCs will be available in due course from UK Data Service Reshare service.\n\nThe 2022 update\n\nIn 2022, a second updated version of the house price per square metre dataset has been published on the London Datastore (hpm_la_2022.zip). This new version extends the data coverage to 2022, but keeps the same publication format as the first publication. The new version is the linked result based on LR-PPD data (1/1/1995-27/6/2022) and Domestic EPCs data (the twelfth version: end with 30/6/2022) downloaded on 13/8/2022 for non-commercial purposes. This uncorrected version of the house price per square metre dataset records almost 20 million transactions in England and Wales since 1995.\nThe match rate of this linked data before 2008 is lower, thus we suggest the user chooses the time coverage needed based on their own research. The id variable has been newly generated for this new data from the twelfth version of the Domestic EPC dataset published by DLUHC, so it is not the same as the id variable in our previous publication(hpm_la.zip) and should not be used to link between the new and the previous publication.\n\nThe National Statistics Postcode Lookup NSPL (August 2022 version) is used to assign the local authority unit for this second publication. An extended version of this dataset containing additional variables from LR-PPD and Domestic EPCs is available on the UK Data Service (  https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/856204/  )\n",

It also estimates the cost of repairing all the homes in London that are in poor condition, calculating how long it would take the savings to pay off the repair costs. The analysis is broken down by tenure and compared with the same figures for the rest of England.\nPrevious Housing Research Notes have analysed topics including housing supply, Help to Buy policy, short-term lettings, international comparisons, the factors behind increasing private rents and race equality. ",

            "summary": "FOCUSONLONDON2011: HOUSING:AGROWINGCITY\n\nWith the highest average incomes in the country but the least space to grow, demand for housing in London has long outstripped supply, resulting in higher housing costs and rising levels of overcrowding. The pressures of housing demand in London have grown in recent years, in part due to fewer people leaving London to buy homes in other regions. But while new supply during the recession held up better in London than in other regions, it needs to increase significantly in order to meet housing needs and reduce housing costs to more affordable levels.\n\nThis edition of Focus on London authored by James Gleeson in the Housing Unit looks at housing trends in London, from the demand/supply imbalance to the consequences for affordability and housing need.\n\nREPORT:\n\nRead the report in PDF format.\n\n\n\nPRESENTATION:\n\nHow much pressure is London’s popularity putting on housing provision in the capital? This interactive presentation looks at the effect on housing pressure of demographic changes, and recent new housing supply, shown by trends in overcrowding and house prices.

            "summary": "This page is no longer being updated. Please use the UK House Price Index instead.\nMix-adjusted house prices, by new/pre-owned dwellings, type of buyer (first time buyer) and region, from February 2002 for London and UK, and average mix-adjusted prices by UK region, and long term Annual House Price Index data since 1969 for London.\nThe ONS House Price Index is mix-adjusted to allow for differences between houses sold (for example type, number of rooms, location) in different months within a year. House prices are modelled using a combination of characteristics to produce a model containing around 100,000 cells (one such cell could be first-time buyer, old dwelling, one bedroom flat purchased in London). Each month estimated prices for all cells are produced by the model and then combined with their appropriate weight to produce mix-adjusted average prices. The index values are based on growth rates in the mix-adjusted average house prices and are annually chain linked.\nThe weights used for mix-adjustment change at the start of each calendar year (i.e. in January). The mix-adjusted prices are therefore not comparable between calendar years, although they are comparable within each calendar year. If you wish to calculate change between years, you should use the mix-adjusted house price index, available in Table 33.\nThe data published in these tables are based on a sub-sample of RMS data. These results will therefore differ from results produced using full sample data. For further information please contact the ONS using the contact details below.  House prices, mortgage advances and incomes have been rounded to the nearest £1,000.  Data taken from Table 2 and Table 9 of the monthly ONS release.\nDownload from ONS website",

            "summary": "\nIntroduction\n\n\nThe GiGL Spaces to Visit dataset provides locations and boundaries for open space sites in Greater London that are available to the public as destinations for leisure, activities and community engagement. It includes green corridors that provide opportunities for walking and cycling.\n\n\nThe dataset has been created by Greenspace Information for Greater London CIC (GiGL). As London’s Environmental Records Centre, GiGL mobilises, curates and shares data that underpin our knowledge of London’s natural environment. We provide impartial evidence to support informed discussion and decision making in policy and practice. \n\n\nGiGL maps under licence from the Greater London Authority. \n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThis dataset is a sub-set of the   GiGL Open Space dataset, the most comprehensive dataset available of open spaces in London. Sites are selected for inclusion in Spaces to Visit based on their public accessibility and likelihood that people would be interested in visiting.\nThe dataset is a mapped Geographic Information System (GIS) polygon dataset where one polygon (or multi-polygon) represents one space. As well as site boundaries, the dataset includes information about a site’s name, size and type (e.g. park, playing field etc.).\nGiGL developed the Spaces to Visit dataset to support anyone who is interested in London’s open spaces - including community groups, web and app developers, policy makers and researchers - with an open licence data source. More detailed and extensive data are available under GiGL data use licences for GIGL partners, researchers and students. Information services are also available for ecological consultants, biological recorders and community volunteers – please see www.gigl.org.uk for more information.\nPlease note that access and opening times are subject to change (particularly at the current time) so if you are planning to visit a site check on the local authority or site website that it is open.\nThe dataset is updated on a quarterly basis. If you have questions about this dataset please contact GiGL’s GIS and Data Officer.\n\nData sources\n\n\nThe boundaries and information in this dataset, are a combination of data collected during the London Survey Method habitat and open space survey programme (1986 – 2008) and information provided to GiGL from other sources since. These sources include London borough surveys, land use datasets, volunteer surveys, feedback from the public, park friends’ groups, and updates made as part of GiGL’s on-going data validation and verification process. \n\n\nDue to data availability, some areas are more up-to-date than others. We are continually working on updating and improving this dataset. If you have any additional information or corrections for sites included in the Spaces to Visit dataset please contact  GiGL’s GIS and Data Officer.\nNOTE: The dataset contains OS data © Crown copyright and database rights 2024. The site boundaries are based on Ordnance Survey mapping, and the data are published under Ordnance Survey's 'presumption to publish'.

            "summary": "This dataset includes the locations and species information for over 880,000 of London's trees. It also includes additional information such as size and age for some of these trees. These are predominantly street trees, but also some trees in parks and other open spaces.\nThe data does not represent the entirety of the capital's urban forest - the London iTree report estimated that there are over eight million trees in London, which includes trees in woodlands, parks, streets, private gardens and more. The data includes 26 of London's 33 boroughs, the City of London and Transport for London.\nAs recognised in the London Urban Forest Plan, collating data about London's urban forest is challenging due to the number of landowners and managers involved, as well as the limited resources available. The Plan committed to undertaking regular updates to this map, and also, over time, to collating a London-wide inventory of publicly owned and managed trees, in line with emerging national standards.\nThe data is used on the London Street Tree Map.\n\nNotes on the data:\n\nThe data on the map includes data provided in 2014-15, during initial data collection, and updated data provided in 2019-20. Where boroughs did not provide updated data in 2019-20, the 2014-15 data has been retained. However, trees may have been surveyed some time before this and so some records may be several years old.\nThe map includes data from 26 of the London boroughs, the City of London and Transport for London (TfL). TfL trees are shown London-wide.\nData has not been received to date from six boroughs. We aim to add any additional data received to the  Datastore  and online map.\nSome large gaps on the map are due to large green spaces (including the Royal Parks), reservoirs, or airports, as well as those boroughs where data is missing.\nThe data received varies significantly by borough. Some boroughs have only included trees on highways, whilst others have included trees on housing land, in schools or in parks. In some cases trees were recorded only when work was carried out.\nThere is not a consistent or agreed format for collecting or recording tree data across London. This presents a challenge in collating data across multiple boroughs. Many boroughs collect a range of information about their trees (e.g. age, height). However this varied by borough in terms of the information collected and categorisations used so we were not able to standardise this information.\nTree species data has been standardised the names to come up with a simplified common name for display on the tree webmap (e. g. “Pear”). These are the common names for the 24 types of tree appearing most frequently in the data (which encompass 90% of all trees), with the remaining trees categorised as “Other”. We have also left the species name as provided by the borough in the data.\nThe ‘tree ID’ number has been added to the data to help map it. This number is not linked to borough’s tree management systems.\n\n\n\n\n   \n\nWarning: Large file size may result in a long download time\n",

Data used comes from ONS' Annual Population Survey (APS).\nThe APS has a sample of around 320,000 people in the UK (around 28,000 in London). As such all figures must be treated with some caution. 95% confidence interval levels are provided.\nNumbers have been rounded to the nearest thousand and figures for smaller populations have been suppressed.\nFour files are available for download:\n\nCountry of Birth - Borough: Shows country of birth estimates in their broad groups such as European Union, South East Asia, North Africa, etc. broken down to borough level.\nDetailed Country of Birth - London: Shows country of birth estimates for specific countries such as France, Bangladesh, Nigeria, etc. available for London as a whole\nDemography Update 09-2015: A GLA Demography report that uses APS data to analyse the trends in London for the period 2004 to 2014. A supporting data file is also provided.\nCountry of Birth Borough 2004-2016 Analysis Tool: A tool produced by GLA Demography that allows users to explore different breakdowns of country of birth data.\n\nAn accompanying Tableau visualisation tool has also been produced which maps data from 2004 to 2015.\n2011 Census Country of Birth data can be found here: https://data.london.gov.uk/census/themes/diversity/\nNationality data can be found here: https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/nationality\nNationality refers to that stated by the respondent during the interview. Country of birth is the country in which they were born. It is possible that an individual’s nationality may change, but the respondent’s country of birth cannot change. This means that country of birth gives a more robust estimate of change over time.",

            "summary": "\nDataset last updated: 8th January 2025\n\nThis dataset provides indicative areas of biodiversity hotspots in Greater London, identified by research and data analysis using methods derived from the Greater London Authority’s (GLA) “Planning for Biodiversity?” report (2016).\nThe dataset has been created by Greenspace Information for Greater London CIC (GiGL). GiGL mobilises, curates and shares data that underpin our knowledge of London’s natural environment. We provide impartial evidence to enable informed discussion and decision-making in policy and practice. The dataset is based on GiGL partnership data which are continuously updated.\nThe underlying data for the dataset may have been subject to changes since the current version was modelled. Subsequent versions will provide updated information from the GiGL database annually. The dataset is a coarse-resolution presentation of high-resolution data. To access data at their original resolution, please contact GiGL or visit www.gigl.org.uk for more information.\nResearch for this dataset has been assisted by London and South East England Local Records Centres (LaSER) and the London Boroughs Biodiversity Forum (LBBF), and is based on advice provided by the Open Data Institute (ODI).\n\n\n\nDescription\nTo meet Policy G6 D of The London Plan (2021), the capital’s spatial development strategy, \" Development proposals should manage impacts on biodiversity and aim to secure net biodiversity gain. This should be informed by the best available ecological information and addressed from the start of the development process\".\n\nThe Biodiversity Hotspots for Planning (BHP) dataset provides developers, homeowners and LPAs an indication of areas, where data are available, that have potential impacts on biodiversity and are likely to be relevant to local planning decisions by applying biodiversity criteria developed by GiGL, based on the original “Planning for Biodiversity?” research. ‘Hotspot’ areas indicate a detected presence of sensitive biodiversity that could potentially be affected by development. Original records can be accessed from GiGL to assist the decision-making process.\n\nN.B. 1: Areas without these biodiversity indicator records may still have undetected biodiversity so should also be considered for biodiversity potential on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\nN.B. 2: The dataset is purely indicative and an ecological data search report must still be commissioned as evidence for planning applications. See  here  for help on this.\n\n\n\n\nSpecification\nThe GIS file shows London as 100m hexagon tiles. Each tile is scored for the known presence of protected species, sites and habitats impact areas based on the impact buffer size as specified in the criteria table below, giving a cumulative score range of 0 to 3. Tiles are considered a hotspot where impact areas overlap the tile by more than 10%.\n\n\n\nTiles with a score of 0 indicate that there are currently no known protected species, sites or habitats impact areas present in that area based on the criteria table, which excludes some protected species. Tiles with a score of 3 indicate the presence of impact areas for all three categories. Intermediate scores indicate the presence of impact areas for one or more of the categories without specifying which are present. The scores can be used in a thematic map to colour the tiles and visually indicate areas with greater presence of impact areas. A sample thematic map is provided.\nThe dataset will be updated annually using the latest protected species, sites and habitats data available to GiGL at time of creation. Please give GiGL appropriate credit when using, adapting or sharing the dataset following the guidance below:\n\nIn-text citation: GiGL, [dataset creation date]\n\nReference: \"Biodiversity Hotspots for Planning\" Greenspace Information for Greater London CIC, [dataset creation date]\n\nWhere data is used in maps: Map displays GiGL data [dataset creation date]\n\nWhere data is summarised but not mapped: Data provided by Greenspace Information for Greater London CIC [dataset creation date]",

            "summary": "Amount charged weekly by Local Authorities for social housing. Rents data are based on the financial year.\nStock figures used to estimate the average for each county, region and the nation are taken at 1st April of the following financial year. Average rents data between 2003/04 and 2007/08 inclusively is based on total stock figures from Housing Revenue Account (HRA) audited base claim form. Before 2003/04 the average rents data is based on total stock figures from the Housing Revenue Account (HRA) second subsidy claim form.\nRents data for 2008/09 are based on total stock figures as at the beginning of the financial year. This data is taken from the HRA subsidy base data form. Average rent data for this year are provisional and will be updated when stock data at the start of the following financial year become available.\nFor a few authorities no rent figure is given because the stock is now very small and the authority no longer reports average rents. For some local authorities the average rent for 2003/04 is lower than in 2002/03. This may be due to some local authorities supplying net rents excluding service charges from 2003/04 onwards. Prior to 2003/04 some of them may have been including service charges in their rent figures. Average rent figures do not account for stock composition.\n'LSVT': all or most of the local authority stock has been transferred to the RSL sector, so the average rent is no longer applicable. LSVTs are not taken into account when calculating county, regional or national averages. MYT (Mid-Year Transfer) refers to those authorities that have transferred their stock in full, part way through the financial year.\nWhere a local authority has transferred part of it's stock mid-year, the stock figure used to estimate averages is taken as at 1st April the following financial year. MYT information is provided from 2003/04 onwards only. Prior to 2003/04 average rents figures may be based on stock figures at the start of the financial year prior to any mid-year transfer.\nThe districts, unitary authorities and counties listed above are based on 1 April 1998 boundaries. Figures for any 'new' re-organised areas have been estimated retrospectively applying the new boundaries back to 1996. Average rents data for 2003/04 and onwards are based on a standardised 52 week collection. Data prior to 2003/04 may have been reported on various different collection scales. Average rent is calculated from stock-owning local authorities that have provided data.\nView Live Tables on Rents and Tenancies on DCLG website\nAverage rents for council owned stock are reported in section H of the Local Authority Housing Statistics data",
