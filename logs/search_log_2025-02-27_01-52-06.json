The cars use fast-response, research-grade instruments to precisely measure pollution concentrations approximately every 1-10 seconds. Pollutants measured include black carbon (BC), CO₂, NO, NO₂, O3, PM2.5 (and other PM size ranges) on a variety of London roadways. The National Physical Laboratory is responsible for regular checks of instrument performance and periodic calibrations.\nThe cars are collecting data from early morning to late evening, Monday to Friday – providing a representative view of on-road air pollution during these hours. The mobile monitoring routes are sampled at different times of day, days of week and time of year – with a target of achieving a minimum of approximately 15 passes of each route over the course of the study (however, traffic congestion and other factors may reduce this number).\nMore information can be found on the Breathe London website.",

The project also implemented a range of technical and commercial solutions aiming to accelerate the transition to EVs for commercial fleet operators, while helping GB’s distribution networks plan and prepare for the mass adoption of EVs. The project aimed to reduce the impact of EVs on distribution networks and ensure security of electricity supply while saving money for electricity customers, helping the UK meet its clean air and climate change objectives.\n\n\nThe project consisted of three trial workstreams (WS):\n\n\n\nWS1, investigating the impact of commercial vehicles charging at homes\n\n\nWS2, monitoring and optimising commercial vehicles charging in depots\n\n\nWS3, which uses private hire vehicle (PHV) journey data to model the impact of these vehicles on the distribution network.\n\n\n\nThe trial period for WS3 began in August 2020, with WS1 and WS2 trials commencing on 1 July 2021. All trials concluded at the end of June 2022.\n\n\nOptimise Prime is sharing the project datasets by making them publicly available to the wider electricity, fleet and PHV industry to optimise their vehicle electrification plans. DNOs, academics and interested parties will be able to utilise this anonymised data created by the project for further research, analysis and forecasting. Along with the datasets, an introductory document is available below, it provides information on the content of those datasets, guidance on how to interpret each data field and instructions on how to access the data.\n\n\nOver the course of the trials, the project has collected and analysed data from a wide range of sources in order to carry out a wide range of experiments. The key datasets collected and used in analysis are available here. These includes:\n\n\nWS1 – Return-to-Home Trials\n\n\n·      Charge Point (CP) session data\n\n\n·      Vehicle telematics journey data\n\n\nWS2 – Depot Trials\n\n\n·      Details of the assets and asset types at each depot\n\n\n·      Charging data gathered from the CPs at each depot\n\n\n·      Building load measurement data from each depot\n\n\n·      Details of the profiled connections, flexibility trials and smart charging profiles trialled at each depot\n\n\nWS3 – Mixed Trials\n\n\n·      PHV charging demand overlaid onto substation available capacity data aggregated by borough\n\n\n\n\n\nThe project is not able to release all data collected and used by the project, as some are commercially confidential to the project partners (such as precise volumes of Uber trips or substation capacities), contains potentially personally identifiable information (such as precise start and end locations of home charging journeys or Uber trips) or were purchased by the project under license (e.g. charge point (CP) locations, weather data and off-street parking data).\n\nAccess the data via this link: https://ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/optimise-prime/information/\n\n\nThe figure below shows how the datasets are built:\n\n\n  \n",

            "summary": "This dataset includes the locations and species information for over 880,000 of London's trees. It also includes additional information such as size and age for some of these trees. These are predominantly street trees, but also some trees in parks and other open spaces.\nThe data does not represent the entirety of the capital's urban forest - the London iTree report estimated that there are over eight million trees in London, which includes trees in woodlands, parks, streets, private gardens and more. The data includes 26 of London's 33 boroughs, the City of London and Transport for London.\nAs recognised in the London Urban Forest Plan, collating data about London's urban forest is challenging due to the number of landowners and managers involved, as well as the limited resources available. The Plan committed to undertaking regular updates to this map, and also, over time, to collating a London-wide inventory of publicly owned and managed trees, in line with emerging national standards.\nThe data is used on the London Street Tree Map.\n\nNotes on the data:\n\nThe data on the map includes data provided in 2014-15, during initial data collection, and updated data provided in 2019-20. Where boroughs did not provide updated data in 2019-20, the 2014-15 data has been retained. However, trees may have been surveyed some time before this and so some records may be several years old.\nThe map includes data from 26 of the London boroughs, the City of London and Transport for London (TfL). TfL trees are shown London-wide.\nData has not been received to date from six boroughs. We aim to add any additional data received to the  Datastore  and online map.\nSome large gaps on the map are due to large green spaces (including the Royal Parks), reservoirs, or airports, as well as those boroughs where data is missing.\nThe data received varies significantly by borough. Some boroughs have only included trees on highways, whilst others have included trees on housing land, in schools or in parks. In some cases trees were recorded only when work was carried out.\nThere is not a consistent or agreed format for collecting or recording tree data across London. This presents a challenge in collating data across multiple boroughs. Many boroughs collect a range of information about their trees (e.g. age, height). However this varied by borough in terms of the information collected and categorisations used so we were not able to standardise this information.\nTree species data has been standardised the names to come up with a simplified common name for display on the tree webmap (e. g. “Pear”). These are the common names for the 24 types of tree appearing most frequently in the data (which encompass 90% of all trees), with the remaining trees categorised as “Other”. We have also left the species name as provided by the borough in the data.\nThe ‘tree ID’ number has been added to the data to help map it. This number is not linked to borough’s tree management systems.\n\n\n\n\n   \n\nWarning: Large file size may result in a long download time\n",

The customers in the trial were recruited as a balanced sample representative of the Greater London population.\nThe dataset contains energy consumption, in kWh (per half hour), unique household identifier, date and time. The CSV file is around 10GB when unzipped and contains around 167million rows.\nWithin the data set are two groups of customers. The first is a sub-group, of approximately 1100 customers, who were subjected to Dynamic Time of Use (dToU) energy prices throughout the 2013 calendar year period. The tariff prices were given a day ahead via the Smart Meter IHD (In Home Display) or text message to mobile phone. Customers were issued High (67.20p/kWh), Low (3.99p/kWh) or normal (11.76p/kWh) price signals and the times of day these applied. The dates/times and the price signal schedule is availaible as part of this dataset. All non-Time of Use customers were on a flat rate tariff of 14.228pence/kWh.\nThe signals given were designed to be representative of the types of signal that may be used in the future to manage both high renewable generation (supply following) operation and also test the potential to use high price signals to reduce stress on local distribution grids during periods of stress.\nThe remaining sample of approximately 4500 customers energy consumption readings were not subject to the dToU tariff.\nMore information can be found on the Low Carbon London webpage\n\nSome analysis of this data can be seen here.",

            "summary": "Updated in Februrary 2017.\nAir quality in London has improved in recent years as a result of policies to reduce emissions, primarily from road transport. However, recently updated maps of pollution concentrations for 2013 (LAEI 2013) still show significant areas of exceedances of the annual mean NO2 EU Limit Values. Improvements are planned to address these, as recently announced in the Mayor’s package of air quality measures.\n\nThe Updated Analysis of Air Pollution Exposure in London research provides an update to similar analysis undertaken in 2013 (which looked at pollution exposure in 2010), published recently by City Hall. It examines pollution exposure in London in 2013 and considers how exposure varies by indicators of age, relative deprivation and ethnic groups in London. It also looks at total exposure (broken down by borough) and exposure at schools.   Through the research described in this report, City Hall is seeking to understand the inequalities in accessing clean air in London and considering how this will be improved by planned air pollution policies.\nThe spreadsheet lists the schools located in areas where average concentrations of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) are over the legal and safe limit as defined by the EU Limit Values; the Limit Value is 40 μg/m3. The modelled NO2 data used in this report is from the 2013 London Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (LAEI), and the list of schools used is from Edubase public portal from the Department of Education.  The list is shown by borough and in descending order with the most polluted first. Further analysis of this data and other indications of the links between air pollution and social gradient in London can be found in the Updated Analysis of Air Pollution Exposure in London.\n",

Please choose the appropriate one depending on which version of MS Office (Access, Excel and Word) you have installed on your machine.\n\nMS Access 2003 Format Database (226mb zipped)\nMS Access 2000 Format Database (219mb zipped)\n\nAll users will also need to download the supporting files and folders in order for either databases to function properly.\nTo use the LAEI please download either of the front-end databases and the supporting files to a local drive and extract the contents to a new folder using the \"use folder names\" option. The contents of the folder to which you extracted the files should look like the example image. Double-click the LAEI_2008.mdb file to start the system.\nDue to the size of this database we recommend working on a local drive rather than over a network.\nFor further details please consult the User Guide and Emission Estimation Methodology Guide which can be found in the Documentation folder after the files have been extracted. In particular please note the final section regarding software object libraries which may be important if you experience any compatibility problems with different version of Access and Excel.\nFind out about Clearing London's air here",

            "summary": "\nIntroduction\n\n\nThe GiGL Spaces to Visit dataset provides locations and boundaries for open space sites in Greater London that are available to the public as destinations for leisure, activities and community engagement. It includes green corridors that provide opportunities for walking and cycling.\n\n\nThe dataset has been created by Greenspace Information for Greater London CIC (GiGL). As London’s Environmental Records Centre, GiGL mobilises, curates and shares data that underpin our knowledge of London’s natural environment. We provide impartial evidence to support informed discussion and decision making in policy and practice. \n\n\nGiGL maps under licence from the Greater London Authority. \n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThis dataset is a sub-set of the   GiGL Open Space dataset, the most comprehensive dataset available of open spaces in London. Sites are selected for inclusion in Spaces to Visit based on their public accessibility and likelihood that people would be interested in visiting.\nThe dataset is a mapped Geographic Information System (GIS) polygon dataset where one polygon (or multi-polygon) represents one space. As well as site boundaries, the dataset includes information about a site’s name, size and type (e.g. park, playing field etc.).\nGiGL developed the Spaces to Visit dataset to support anyone who is interested in London’s open spaces - including community groups, web and app developers, policy makers and researchers - with an open licence data source. More detailed and extensive data are available under GiGL data use licences for GIGL partners, researchers and students. Information services are also available for ecological consultants, biological recorders and community volunteers – please see www.gigl.org.uk for more information.\nPlease note that access and opening times are subject to change (particularly at the current time) so if you are planning to visit a site check on the local authority or site website that it is open.\nThe dataset is updated on a quarterly basis. If you have questions about this dataset please contact GiGL’s GIS and Data Officer.\n\nData sources\n\n\nThe boundaries and information in this dataset, are a combination of data collected during the London Survey Method habitat and open space survey programme (1986 – 2008) and information provided to GiGL from other sources since. These sources include London borough surveys, land use datasets, volunteer surveys, feedback from the public, park friends’ groups, and updates made as part of GiGL’s on-going data validation and verification process. \n\n\nDue to data availability, some areas are more up-to-date than others. We are continually working on updating and improving this dataset. If you have any additional information or corrections for sites included in the Spaces to Visit dataset please contact  GiGL’s GIS and Data Officer.\nNOTE: The dataset contains OS data © Crown copyright and database rights 2024. The site boundaries are based on Ordnance Survey mapping, and the data are published under Ordnance Survey's 'presumption to publish'. When using these data please acknowledge GiGL and Ordnance Survey as the source of the information using the following citation:\n\n‘Dataset created by Greenspace Information for Greater London CIC (GiGL), 2024 – Contains Ordnance Survey and public sector information licensed under the   Open Government Licence v3.0  ’\n",
