            "summary": "The data contained in this repository relates to London's Creative Enterprise Zones. It can be used to review job and business data for each CEZ, as well as several other creative areas across London.\nAbout the data\nSectors\nThe data relates specifically to creative sector SIC codes (standard industrial classification) as defined by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). The list of SIC codes is provided in the repository below (activity_subsector_sic.csv).\nSources\n\nJob counts are from the ONS Business Register & Employment Survey. Job counts are estimated through a survey of a sample businesses throughout the country. The survey takes place annually in September. Job data is currently only available up to the 2021 survey. The data only counts employees; it does not include sole traders/freelancers.\n\nBusiness counts are from the ONS UK Business Counts. The count is based on active businesses and takes place annually in March. Business data is available up to the 2022 survey. Freelancers/sole traders may be included in these counts if they are registered with Companies House (e.g. as a limited company) at an address within the relevant creative area.\nNote that because of the difference in survey months, there may be a lag between job and business trends. For example, job counts taken in 2020 (September) will likely be lower than previous years because they will be affected by Covid-19 related job losses, whereas business counts taken in 2020 (March) will likely not show major fluctuation from previous years because the Covid-19 related impacts won't yet have registered.\n\nTurnover and births & deaths information comes from ONS Interdepartmental Business Register (IDBR). Because of data suppression, it is only available down to local authority level. The data has been scaled to estimate the amount of turnover, births, and deaths per creative area. For example, if a borough has 500 creative businesses producing 50m turnover, we would average 100k turnover per business. If the creative area in that borough has 100 creative businesses, 100 x 100,000 in turnover = 10m throughout the creative area.\nFor CEZ across two or more authorities, we have used the sum of turnover/births/deaths in the composite authorities as the basis for calculation.\nNote that subsector or activity counts for births/deaths may not add up to the figures in the total births/deaths data due to rounding.\nAs a result, data on turnover, births & deaths should be treated as broad estimates only.\n\n\nGeographies\n\n\nJob counts and business counts relate to the best-fit middle super output areas (MSOAs) for the boundary of each Creative Enterprise Zone. The MSOAs have been agreed with CEZ managers.\n\nTurnover and births & deaths have been scaled from local authority-level data to the MSOAs above.\nThe list of MSOAs is provided in the repository below (cez_msoas.csv).\nGuide to spreadsheets\nThe spreadsheets below provide various configurations of the job and business counts, turnover, and births & deaths data.\nBreakdowns are provided for area and aggregate data:\n\nArea data relates to individual creative areas (i.e. individual Creative Enterprise Zones and non-CEZ comparison areas)\nAggregate data relates to collections of creative areas (e.g. all CEZ areas, all comparator areas)\n\nFor both area and aggregate data, the following configurations are provided per year (listed from most general to most granular):\n\nHeadline data\nActivities (i.e. consumption or production)\nSubsectors (e.g. architecture, photography)\nActivities x subsectors (e.g. consumption - screen and digital, production - screen and digital)\nSpecific subsectors by 5-digit SIC code (job and business counts only)\n\nGuide to Creative Enterprise Zones data explorer\nThe data has been built into an interactive explorer for quick visualisation and analysis, which is available here. The explorer takes around five seconds to load initially and works best on a laptop or desktop (not mobile). Tips for using the explorer:\n\n2022 data is currently only available for business counts\nExport any of the graphs as a .png using the small icon in the top-right of a graph\nIn the subsector graphs, single-click a legend item to remove it from the graph, or double-click a legend item to only show that item on the graph\n",

            "summary": "\nIntroduction\n\nThe GiGL Open Space Friends Group subset provides locations and boundaries for selected open space sites in Greater London.\nThe chosen sites represent sites that have established Friends Groups in Greater London and are therefore important to local communities, even if they may not be accessible open spaces, or don’t typically function as destinations for leisure, activities and community engagement*.\nFriends Groups are groups of interested local people who come together to protect, enhance and improve their local open space or spaces.\nThe dataset has been created by Greenspace Information for Greater London CIC (GiGL). As London’s Environmental Records Centre, GiGL mobilises, curates and shares data that underpin our knowledge of London’s natural environment. We provide impartial evidence to support informed discussion and decision making in policy and practice.\nGiGL maps under licence from the Greater London Authority. \n*Publicly accessible sites for leisure, activities and community engagement can be found in GiGL's Spaces to Visit dataset\n\nDescription\n\n\nThis dataset is a sub-set of the  GiGL Open Space dataset, the most comprehensive dataset available of open spaces in London. Sites are selected for inclusion in the Friends Group subset based on whether there is a friends group recorded for the site in the Open Space dataset.\nThe dataset is a mapped Geographic Information System (GIS) polygon dataset where one polygon (or multi-polygon) represents one space. As well as site boundaries, the dataset includes information about a site’s name, size, access and type (e.g. park, playing field etc.) and the name and/or web address of the site’s friends group.\nGiGL developed the dataset to support anyone who is interested in identifying sites in London with friends groups - including friends groups and other community groups, web and app developers, policy makers and researchers - with an open licence data source. More detailed and extensive data are available under GiGL data use licences for GIGL partners, researchers and students. Information services are also available for ecological consultants, biological recorders, community groups and members of the public – please see www.gigl.org.uk for more information.\nThe dataset is updated on a quarterly basis. If you have questions about this dataset please contact GiGL’s GIS and Data Officer.\n\nData sources\n\n\nThe boundaries and information in this dataset are a combination of data collected during the London Survey Method habitat and open space survey programme (1986 – 2008) and information provided to GiGL from other sources since. These sources include London borough surveys, land use datasets, volunteer surveys, feedback from the public, park friends’ groups, and updates made as part of GiGL’s on-going data validation and verification process. \n\n\nThis is a preliminary version of the dataset as there is currently low coverage of friends groups in GiGL’s Open Space database. We are continually working on updating and improving this dataset. If you have any additional information or corrections for sites included in GiGL’s Friends Group subset please contact  GiGL’s GIS and Data Officer.\nNOTE: The dataset contains OS data © Crown copyright and database rights 2024. The site boundaries are based on Ordnance Survey mapping, and the data are published under Ordnance Survey's 'presumption to publish'.

This is not a fully comprehensive dataset and is based on multiple sources of information. Subsequent versions will provide updates as more information becomes available. Read more here.\nThe dataset has been created by Greenspace Information for Greater London CIC (GiGL). GiGL mobilises, curates and shares data that underpin our knowledge of London’s natural environment. We provide impartial evidence to enable informed discussion and decision-making in policy and practice.\nGiGL maps under licence from the Greater London Authority. Research for this dataset has been assisted by The Guardian Cities team.\nData sources\nBoundaries and attributes are based on GiGL’s Open Space dataset, which is a collated dataset of spatial and attribute information from various sources, including: habitat and open space survey information provided to GiGL by the GLA and London boroughs, borough open space survey information where provided to GiGL or available under open licence, other attribute information inferred from field visits or research. Available open space information has been analysed by GiGL to identify POPS included in this dataset. Future updates to the GiGL Open Space dataset will inform future, improved releases of the POPS dataset.\nDefinition\nFor the purposes of creating the dataset, POPS have been carefully defined as below. The definition is based on review of similar definitions internationally and appropriateness for application to available London data.\nPrivately Owned Public Spaces (POPS): publicly accessible spaces which are provided and maintained by private developers, offices or residential building owners. They include city squares, atriums and small parks. The spaces provide several functional amenities for the public. They are free to enter and may be open 24 hours or have restricted access arrangements. Whilst the spaces look public, there are often constraints to use.\nFor the Greater London dataset no consideration is taken as to a site’s formal status in planning considerations, and only unenclosed POPS are included.\nPOPS may be destination spaces, which attract visitors from outside of the space’s immediate area and are designed for use by a broad audience, or neighbourhood spaces, which draw residents and employees from the immediate locale and are usually strongly linked with the adjacent street or host building. These spaces are of high quality and include a range of amenities. The POPS may also be a hiatus space, accommodating the passing user for a brief stop only – for example it may include seating but few other amenities, a circulation space, designed to improve a pedestrian’s journey from A to B, or a marginal space, which whilst a public space is not very accommodating and experiences low levels of usage.

Kayden, The New York City Department of City Planning, and the Municipal Art Society of New York, published by John Wiley & Sons, 2000).\nNOTE: The boundaries are based on Ordnance Survey mapping and the data is published under Ordnance Survey's 'presumption to publish'.Contains OS data © Crown copyright and database rights 2017.",

            "summary": "\nIntroduction\n\n\nThe GiGL Spaces to Visit dataset provides locations and boundaries for open space sites in Greater London that are available to the public as destinations for leisure, activities and community engagement. It includes green corridors that provide opportunities for walking and cycling.\n\n\nThe dataset has been created by Greenspace Information for Greater London CIC (GiGL). As London’s Environmental Records Centre, GiGL mobilises, curates and shares data that underpin our knowledge of London’s natural environment. We provide impartial evidence to support informed discussion and decision making in policy and practice. \n\n\nGiGL maps under licence from the Greater London Authority. \n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThis dataset is a sub-set of the   GiGL Open Space dataset, the most comprehensive dataset available of open spaces in London. Sites are selected for inclusion in Spaces to Visit based on their public accessibility and likelihood that people would be interested in visiting.\nThe dataset is a mapped Geographic Information System (GIS) polygon dataset where one polygon (or multi-polygon) represents one space. As well as site boundaries, the dataset includes information about a site’s name, size and type (e.g. park, playing field etc.).\nGiGL developed the Spaces to Visit dataset to support anyone who is interested in London’s open spaces - including community groups, web and app developers, policy makers and researchers - with an open licence data source. More detailed and extensive data are available under GiGL data use licences for GIGL partners, researchers and students. Information services are also available for ecological consultants, biological recorders and community volunteers – please see www.gigl.org.uk for more information.\nPlease note that access and opening times are subject to change (particularly at the current time) so if you are planning to visit a site check on the local authority or site website that it is open.\nThe dataset is updated on a quarterly basis. If you have questions about this dataset please contact GiGL’s GIS and Data Officer.\n\nData sources\n\n\nThe boundaries and information in this dataset, are a combination of data collected during the London Survey Method habitat and open space survey programme (1986 – 2008) and information provided to GiGL from other sources since. These sources include London borough surveys, land use datasets, volunteer surveys, feedback from the public, park friends’ groups, and updates made as part of GiGL’s on-going data validation and verification process. \n\n\nDue to data availability, some areas are more up-to-date than others. We are continually working on updating and improving this dataset. If you have any additional information or corrections for sites included in the Spaces to Visit dataset please contact  GiGL’s GIS and Data Officer.\nNOTE: The dataset contains OS data © Crown copyright and database rights 2024. The site boundaries are based on Ordnance Survey mapping, and the data are published under Ordnance Survey's 'presumption to publish'.

            "summary": "\nInformation  \n\n\nThese published reports present information from the multi-agency database Combined Homelessness and Information Network (CHAIN), about people seen rough sleeping by outreach teams in London. CHAIN, which is commissioned and funded by the Greater London Authority (GLA) and managed by Homeless Link, represents one of the UK’s most detailed and comprehensive sources of information about rough sleeping. \n\n\nServices that record information on CHAIN include outreach teams, assessment centres, accommodation projects, day centres and other specialist projects. The system allows users to share information about work done with people sleeping rough and about their needs, ensuring that they receive the most appropriate support and that efforts are not duplicated. \n\n\nIn these reports, people are counted as having been seen rough sleeping if they have been encountered by a commissioned outreach worker bedded down on the street, or in other open spaces or locations not designed for habitation, such as doorways, stairwells, parks or derelict buildings. The report does not include people from “hidden homeless” groups such as those “sofa surfing” or living in squats, unless they have also been seen bedded down in one of the settings outlined above. \n\n\nSeparate reports are produced for London as a whole and for individual boroughs, and these are published each quarter. There are also annual reports that contain aggregated information for each full year. \n\n\nInteractive Visualisation Tool \n\n\nQuarterly Data Tool\n\n\nAnnual Data Tool\n\n\nA suite of online interactive charts and maps based on CHAIN data is available by clicking the above links. The data available via these tools mirrors that presented in the published PDF documents, with the addition of filters and other enhancements to allow users to interrogate the data. The Quarterly Data Tool shows data from the last eight quarters, and the Annual Data Tool shows data from the last five years.  \n\n\nOrganisations Using CHAIN  \n\n\nA list of the  organisations which have signed the CHAIN Data Protection Agreement  and are able to access the live CHAIN system is also available to download. \n\n\nPDF Reports & Data tables \n\n\nAs of January 2024, published CHAIN PDF reports are accompanied by an OpenDocument Spreadsheet file providing the underlying data in an accessible aggregated tabular format. The file includes data at local authority level, and for London overall, including comparative data for previous periods. There is also an accompanying  explanatory notes  document, which provides important contextual information about the data. \n\n\nPlease click the links below to download a zip file containing the PDF reports and OpenDocument Spreadsheet for the corresponding timeframe.  \n\n\nPublication Schedule  \n\n\nReports are published 1 month after the end of each quarter and one quarter after the end of each year.

            "summary": "\nDataset last updated: 8th January 2025\n\nThis dataset provides indicative areas of biodiversity hotspots in Greater London, identified by research and data analysis using methods derived from the Greater London Authority’s (GLA) “Planning for Biodiversity?” report (2016).\nThe dataset has been created by Greenspace Information for Greater London CIC (GiGL). GiGL mobilises, curates and shares data that underpin our knowledge of London’s natural environment. We provide impartial evidence to enable informed discussion and decision-making in policy and practice. The dataset is based on GiGL partnership data which are continuously updated.\nThe underlying data for the dataset may have been subject to changes since the current version was modelled. Subsequent versions will provide updated information from the GiGL database annually. The dataset is a coarse-resolution presentation of high-resolution data. To access data at their original resolution, please contact GiGL or visit www.gigl.org.uk for more information.\nResearch for this dataset has been assisted by London and South East England Local Records Centres (LaSER) and the London Boroughs Biodiversity Forum (LBBF), and is based on advice provided by the Open Data Institute (ODI).\n\n\n\nDescription\nTo meet Policy G6 D of The London Plan (2021), the capital’s spatial development strategy, \" Development proposals should manage impacts on biodiversity and aim to secure net biodiversity gain. This should be informed by the best available ecological information and addressed from the start of the development process\".\n\nThe Biodiversity Hotspots for Planning (BHP) dataset provides developers, homeowners and LPAs an indication of areas, where data are available, that have potential impacts on biodiversity and are likely to be relevant to local planning decisions by applying biodiversity criteria developed by GiGL, based on the original “Planning for Biodiversity?” research. ‘Hotspot’ areas indicate a detected presence of sensitive biodiversity that could potentially be affected by development. Original records can be accessed from GiGL to assist the decision-making process.\n\nN.B. 1: Areas without these biodiversity indicator records may still have undetected biodiversity so should also be considered for biodiversity potential on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\nN.B. 2: The dataset is purely indicative and an ecological data search report must still be commissioned as evidence for planning applications. See  here  for help on this.\n\n\n\n\nSpecification\nThe GIS file shows London as 100m hexagon tiles. Each tile is scored for the known presence of protected species, sites and habitats impact areas based on the impact buffer size as specified in the criteria table below, giving a cumulative score range of 0 to 3. Tiles are considered a hotspot where impact areas overlap the tile by more than 10%.\n\n\n\nTiles with a score of 0 indicate that there are currently no known protected species, sites or habitats impact areas present in that area based on the criteria table, which excludes some protected species. Tiles with a score of 3 indicate the presence of impact areas for all three categories. Intermediate scores indicate the presence of impact areas for one or more of the categories without specifying which are present. The scores can be used in a thematic map to colour the tiles and visually indicate areas with greater presence of impact areas. A sample thematic map is provided.\nThe dataset will be updated annually using the latest protected species, sites and habitats data available to GiGL at time of creation. Please give GiGL appropriate credit when using, adapting or sharing the dataset following the guidance below:\n\nIn-text citation: GiGL, [dataset creation date]\n\nReference: \"Biodiversity Hotspots for Planning\" Greenspace Information for Greater London CIC, [dataset creation date]\n\nWhere data is used in maps: Map displays GiGL data [dataset creation date]\n\nWhere data is summarised but not mapped: Data provided by Greenspace Information for Greater London CIC [dataset creation date]",

            "summary": " OpenStreetMap (openstreetmap.org) is a global collaborative mapping project, which offers maps and map data released with an open license, encouraging free re-use and re-distribution. The data is created by a large community of volunteers who use a variety of simple on-the-ground surveying techniques, and wiki-syle editing tools to collaborate as they create the maps, in a process which is open to everyone. The project originated in London, and an active community of mappers and developers are based here. Mapping work in London is ongoing (and you can help!) but the coverage is already good enough for many uses.\nBrowse the map of London on OpenStreetMap.org\nDownloads:\nThe whole of England updated daily:\n\nengland.osm.bz2 ~185M - .osm formatted raw XML data (compressed)\nengland.shp.zip ~156M - ESRI shapefiles\n\nFor more details of downloads available from OpenStreetMap, including downloading the whole planet, see 'planet.osm' on the wiki.\nData access APIs:\nDownload small areas of the map by bounding-box. For example this URL requests the data around Trafalgar Square: http://api.openstreetmap.org/api/0.6/map?bbox=-0.13062,51.5065,-0.12557,51.50969\nData filtered by \"tag\". For example this URL returns all elements in London tagged shop=supermarket: http://www.informationfreeway.org/api/0.6/*[shop=supermarket][bbox=-0.48,51.30,0.21,51.70]\nThe .osm format\nThe format of the data is a raw XML represention of all the elements making up the map. OpenStreetMap is composed of interconnected \"nodes\" and \"ways\" (and sometimes \"relations\") each with a set of name=value pairs called \"tags\". These classify and describe properties of the elements, and ultimately influence how they get drawn on the map. To understand more about tags, and different ways of working with this data format refer to the following pages on the OpenStreetMap wiki.\n\n.osm - About the raw XML data format of OpenStreetMap\nDownloading data - More details of the API and extract download options\nXapi - The extended api for filtering by tag\nMap Features - A list of tags, and what map features they represent\nConverting map data between formats - catalogue of tools for converting from .osm to other formats\n\nSimple embedded maps\nRather than working with raw map data, you may prefer to embed maps from OpenStreetMap on your website with a simple bit of javascript. You can also present overlays of other data, in a manner very similar to working with google maps. In fact you can even use the google maps API to do this. See OSM on your own website for details and links to various javascript map libraries.\nHelp build the map!\nThe OpenStreetMap project aims to attract large numbers of contributors who all chip in a little bit to help build the map. Although the map editing tools take a little while to learn, they are designed to be as simple as possible, so that everyone can get involved. This project offers an exciting means of allowing local London communities to take ownership of their part of the map.\nRead about how to Get Involved and see the London page for details of OpenStreetMap community events.",

            "summary": "A series of London-wide climate risk maps has been produced to analyse climate exposure and vulnerability across Greater London. These maps were produced by Bloomberg Associates in collaboration with the Greater London Authority to help the GLA and other London-based organisations deliver equitable responses to the impacts of climate change and target resources to support communities at highest risk.\nClimate vulnerability relates to people’s exposure to climate impacts like flooding or heatwaves, but also to personal and social factors that affect their ability to cope with and respond to extreme events. High climate risk coincides with areas of income and health inequalities. A series of citywide maps overlays key metrics to identify areas within London that are most exposed to climate impacts with high concentrations of vulnerable populations.\nIn 2022, Bloomberg Associates updated London’s climate risk maps to include additional data layers at a finer geographic scale (LSOA boundaries). These maps were built upon earlier maps using the Transport for London (Tfl) hexagonal grid (often referred to in this report as the “Hex Grid”). In addition, the map interface was updated to allow users to compare individual data layers to the Overall, Heat and Flooding Climate Risk maps. Users can now also see the specific metrics for each individual LSOA to understand which factors are driving risk throughout the city. \nIn 2024, Bloomberg Associates further modernized the climate risk maps by updating the social factor layers to employ more recent (2021) census data. In addition, air temperature at the surface was used in place of just surface temperature, as a more accurate assessment of felt heat.\nThe Mayor is addressing these climate risks and inequalities through the work of the London Recovery Board, which includes projects and programmes to address climate risks and ensure a green recovery from the pandemic. Ambitious policies in the London Environment Strategy and recently published new London Plan are also addressing London’s climate risks.\nThe data layers at the LSOA level are available here to use in GIS software:\nClimate risk scores (overall, heat, and flood): https://cityhall.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=22484ef240624e149735ca1aaa4c9ade#\nSocial and physical risk variables: https://cityhall.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=bc06d80731f146b393f8631a0f98c213#",

It brings together publicly available data relevant to equalities in London into a series of measures. These will be updated over time to monitor the delivery of the strategy.\nAfter the Covid-19 pandemic struck in 2020, there was a need to capture and bring together appropriate data and research to monitor London through the recovery period. As a result, the GLA set up the London Covid-19 Resilience Dashboard.\nWithin the dashboard, a section was created that focused on ‘narrowing inequalities’, one of the cross-cutting principles underpinning the GLA’s recovery work. We, therefore, direct your attention to this dashboard as a way of monitoring equalities in London.",

For this project Toynbee Hall worked with a group of peer researchers who had lived experience of being part of one or more of the priority groups identified by the GLA as having the most to gain from adult education.\nOver the course of five months peer researchers co-designed and co-produced the research and conducted in-depth interviews with over 50 people from across London about how adult education services could be improved. For this project Toynbee Hall adopted a Participatory Action Research (PAR) approach. This style of research involves professional researchers and members of communities (peer researchers) working in partnership to develop the project scope, carry out the data collection, and analyse the findings.\nAs an important aim of this project was to improve access to adult education, this research deliberately focused on the barriers experienced by those who participated in the study, and how they felt access to and engagement with adult education could be improved. The report also learns from the positive experiences that some interviewees shared and have referenced some of this good practice in it’s recommendations. It should be noted that as a qualitative piece of work interviews should not be taken as a statistically representative sample of all Londoners but rather an in-depth look at the experiences of some of the more marginalised of Londoners.\n\nClick here to read a blog from the peer researchers who conducted the research, speaking about the findings and their experiences of carrying out the project.",

            "summary": "Overview\nAn updated spatial data set for existing green roofs has been produced for London's Central Activities Zone (CAZ) using 2015 aerial imagery. The CAZ makes up around two per cent of London's total area.\nMethod\nArcMap GIS software was used to map green roofs installations. The aerial imagery was loaded into the software in true colour (RGB) and infrared (IR) composites, along with the CAZ boundary and London 500x500m Ordnance Survey grid to aid locating.\n\n\n\nRGB images are useful for both roof types with IR being very good for identifying vegetation. IR allows for easy identification of vegetation due to it reflecting strongly in the near infrared (NIR) and appearing deep red in colour (healthy vegetation).\nChallenges and solutions\nThe problem of judging elevation from aerial imagery, particularly of buildings with only a few stories can be partially overcome by comparing the location with Google Maps Earth view. This includes a digital elevation model that makes it easier to judge whether a green area is raised or at street level. \n\n\n\nA number of small roof terraces in the CAZ have very dense vegetation along the edge of the roof. Where this kind of greening is spatially significant, the vegetation itself has been mapped rather than the full extent of the roof, in order to produce a more appropriate and accurate green area value. \n\n\n\nBuilding shadows can mask the texture and colour of the roof. The use of NIR helps with green roof identification, as the contrast of the red of the vegetation with the surrounding area is far higher than in RGB, making the shadow less impactful.\n\n\n\nSome roofs that appear very uniformly green in RGB may be Astroturf as opposed to a living green roof. This can usually be identified by inspecting the roof in IR, as it will not give the distinctive deep/bright red colours of living vegetation, displaying instead as blue-purple. \n\n\n\nEven analysing a small area of London, such as the CAZ, takes a long time. This is the main reason why this study methodology has not been extended beyond the CAZ.",

For 2013/14 and 2011/12 the figures are average weekly income.\nThey are calculated using a model based method to produce the following four estimates of income using a combination of survey data from the Family Resources Survey, and previously published data from the 2011 Census and a number of administrative data sources. The four different measures of income are:\n\nTotal household income\nNet household income\nNet household income (equivalised) before housing costs\nNet household income (equivalised) after housing costs\n\nTotal annual household income is the sum of the gross income of every member of the household plus any income from benefits such as Working Families Tax Credit.\nNet annual household income is the sum of the net income of every member of the household. It is calculated using the same components as total income but income is net of:\n\nincome tax payments;\nnational insurance contributions;\ndomestic rates/council tax;\ncontributions to occupational pension schemes;\nall maintenance and child support payments, which are deducted from the income of the person making the payments; and\nparental contribution to students living away from home.\n\nNet annual household income before housing costs (equivalised) is composed of the same elements as net household weekly income but is subject to the OECD’s equivalisation scale.\nNet annual household income after housing costs (equivalised) is composed of the same elements of net household weekly income but is subject to the following deductions prior to the OECD’s equivalisation scale being applied:\n\nrent (gross of housing benefit);\nwater rates, community water charges and council water charges;\nmortgage interest payments (net of any tax relief);\nstructural insurance premiums (for owner occupiers); and\nground rent and service charges.\n\nFor detailed information on aspects of the quality and methodology behind these statistics, see the Technical Report.\n\nThis dataset is included in the Greater London Authority's Night Time Observatory.

The initiative explores the potential for the GLA to pledge to civic crowdfunding projects as ‘one of the crowd’, enabling London’s citizens to deliver and manage spaces and places that suit local needs and identities.\nThis study, commissioned by the Regeneration Unit and undertaken by the GLA’s Opinion Research team, attends to the ‘softer’ social impacts of regeneration interventions that can be easily overlooked in traditional evaluative research for policy. Significantly, the report deals only and entirely with non-financial benefits of civic crowdfunding, attending to a gap in research previously identified by Nesta (2015). Through a period of qualitative research, specifically semi-structured interviews and non-participant observation, with a sample of 7 project groups, insight and understanding has been gathered on the experiences of those who embark on delivering a project as part of the Mayor’s Crowdfunding Programme.\nTechnical Details\n\nResults and findings are based on in depth qualitative research with 7 project groups funded in Rounds 1 or 2 of the Mayor’s Crowdfunding Programme.\nResearch was undertaken on projects’ sites throughout May of 2016.\nAll data collection was undertaken with the same template, by the same researcher. All data was thematically coded into one data-set.\nParticipants were self-selecting, from the pool of funded projects. The research does not claim to speak for all project experiences, or experiences outside of the Mayor’s Crowdfunding Programme\n",

It tracks the prices paid for renting property from private landlords in Great Britain.\nIPHRP is produced from a number of administrative sources and is classified as experimental by ONS.\nThe index compares trends (rather than levels) in average private sector rents across English regions, Wales and Scotland. It uses a complex mix-adjustment and weighting process to produce a single index for each area. This index uses data on actual new and ongoing rents.\nThe sample ensures that the index is representative of the stock at regional level and that it isn't distorted by units dropping out of the sample because they switch to LHA or for other reasons. This is an advantage over the VOA dataset where the sample is changing over time and may not be representative.\nTables show monthly data. Data is updated once a quarter.\nIndex level (January 2011 = 100). Not seasonally adjusted.\nSee more on the ONS Website\n",

This decision was taken because it was felt to be too great an additional burden for schools in the context of a rapid roll out.\nInstead, GLA have sought to understand levels of take-up through a number of different sources. This has included work with the management information systems (MIS) provider Arbor, insights gathered through discussions with boroughs and where schools have claimed funding over the initial 90% allocations. These sources have shown a range of uptake levels, from around 58% up to 100%.\n\nArbor provides Management Information Systems (MIS) to over 6,000 schools across the country. They kindly offered to provide data from the schools they support in London, so that the GLA can gain a picture of what Universal Primary Free School Meals (UFSM) ‘uptake’ levels are, and how it may differ for different groups of pupils and areas.\nThis document outlines the GLA City Intelligence Unit's analysis of the Arbor data sample for the Academic Year 2023/24 including uptake and trends by:\n\nAcademic Term\nYear group\nSpecial Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) status\nEthnicity\nReligion\n",

This tool is not a prescriptive guide to where canopy cover should be increased. It is designed as a tool to help decision-makers including local authorities, NGOs and funders, as well as Londoners, to identify where canopy cover is low, and where further consideration might be given to increasing canopy cover, based on a suite of different factors.\n\n[1] Wards correct as of March 2019.

From 2002 the stock figures include self-contained units and bedspaces. From 2005 there was some general needs stock was reclassified as supported stock. This may have resulted in some of the older person stock being counted as bed spaces rather than self contained units.\nThe districts, unitary authorities and counties listed above are based on 1 April 1998 boundaries. Figures for any \"new\" re-organised areas have been estimated retrospectively applying the new boundaries back to 1997, making appropriate assumptions for any county re-organisation which involved cutting across districts.\nNumbers can increase dramatically from one year to another as a result of Large Scale Voluntary Transfers from local authority stock. Decreases are usually the result of sales or demolitions.\nData on dwelling stock from DCLG website",

This dataset is not updated.\nPayments over £250 made by the London Fire Brigade (LFEPA) as part of the government and Mayor of London's transparency agenda. As of November 2012 the threshold for expenditure changed from £500 to £250 at request of the Mayor. The Local Government Transparency Code 2015 requires the data to indicate VAT for payments which cannot be recovered; there are no such payments for LFB/LFEPA as all VAT is recoverable. The Transparency Code also requires a 'merchant category' to be added to payment details. LFEPA has 'Proclass' data and this has been added to published data (from January 2015). Please note that approximately 75 per cent of LFEPA vendors currently have a Proclass classification and this may result in a small number of payments not having a ‘merchant category’.\nLFEPA runs the London Fire Brigade (LFB).",
