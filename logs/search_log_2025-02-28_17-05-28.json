            "summary": "About the dataset\nThis dataset uses information from the DWP benefit system to provide estimates of children living in poverty for wards in London. In order to be counted in this dataset, a family must have claimed Child Benefit and at least one other household benefit (Universal Credit, tax credits or Housing Benefit) during the year. The numbers are calibrated to the Households Below Average Income (HBAI) dataset used to provide the government's headline poverty statistics. The definition of relative low income is living in a household with equivalised* income before housing costs (BHC) below 60% of contemporary national median income. The income measure includes contributions from earnings, state support and pensions.\nFurther detail on the estimates of dependent children living in relative low income, including alternative geographical breakdowns and additional variables, such as age of children, family type and work status are available from DWP's statistical tabulation tool Stat-Xplore. Minor adjustments to the data have been applied to guard against the identification of individual claimants.\nThis dataset replaced the DWP children in out-of-work benefit households and HMRC children in low income families local measure releases.\nThis dataset includes estimates for all wards in London of numbers of dependent children living in relative low income families for each financial year from 2014/15 to the latest available (2022/23). The figures for the latest year are provisional and are subject to minor revision when the next dataset is released by DWP.\n\n\n\nHeadlines\n\nNumber of children\n\nThe number of dependent children living in relative low income across London, rose from below 310,000 in the financial year ending 2015 to over 420,000 in the financial year ending 2020, but has decreased since then to below 350,000, which is well below the number for financial year ending 2018. While many wards in London have followed a similar pattern, the numbers of children in low income families in some wards have fallen more sharply, while the numbers in other wards have continued to grow.\n\nProportion of children in each London ward\n\nWard population sizes vary across London, the age profile of that population also varies and both the size and make-up of the population can change over time, so in order to make more meaningful comparisons between wards or over time, DWP have also published rates, though see note below regarding caution when using these figures.\nA dependent child is anyone aged under 16; or aged 16 to 19 in full-time non-advanced education or in unwaged government training. Ward level estimates for the total number of dependent children are not available, so percentages cannot be derived. Ward level estimates for the percentage of children under 16 living in low income families are usually published by DWP but, in its latest release, ward-level population estimates were not available at the time, so no rates were published. To derive the rates in this dataset, the GLA has used the ONS's latest ward-level population estimates (official statistics in development). Percentages for 2021/22 are calculated using the 2021 mid year estimates, while percentages for 2022/23 are calculated using the 2022 mid year estimates. As these are official statistics in development, rates therefore need to be treated with some caution.\n\nNotes\n\n*equivalised income is adjusted for household size and composition in order to compare living standards between households of different types.",

            "summary": "These ward level well being scores present a combined measure of well-being indicators of the resident population based on 12 different indicators. Where possible each indicator score is compared with the England and Wales average, which is zero. Scores over 0 indicate a higher probability that the population on average will experience better well-being according to these measures.\nUsers can adjust the weight of each indicator depending on what they consider to be the more or less important, thus generating bespoke scores. This is done either by entering a number between 0 and 10. The scores throughout the spreadsheet will update automatically.\nThe tool combines data across a range of themes for the last five years of available data (2009-2013).\nEither view the results in the online interactive tool here,\n\n\n\n\n\nOr download the interactive spreadsheet here \n\n\n\nThe well-being scores are then presented in a ranked bar chart for each borough, and a ward map of London.\nThe spreadsheet also highlights wards in the top and bottom 25 per cent in London. Wards that have shown significant improvement or reduction in their scores relative to the average over the five year period are also highlighted.\nBorough figures are provided to assist with comparisons.\nRankings and summary tables are included. The source data that the tool is based on is included in the spreadsheet.\nThe Excel file is 8.1MB.\nIMPORTANT NOTE, users must enable macros when prompted upon opening the Excel spreadsheet (or reset security to medium/low) for the map to function. The rest of the tool will function without macros.\nIf you cannot download the Excel file directly try this zip file (2.6MB).\nIf you experience any difficulties with downloading this spreadsheet, please contact the London Datastore in the Intelligence Unit.\nDetailed information about definitions and sources is contained within the spreadsheet.\nThe 12 measures included are:\nHealth \n - Life Expectancy\n - Childhood Obesity\n - Incapacity Benefits claimant rate\nEconomic security\n - Unemployment rate\nSafety\n - Crime rate\n - Deliberate Fires\nEducation\n - GCSE point scores\nChildren\n - Unauthorised Pupil Absence\nFamilies\n - Children in out-of-work households\nTransport\n - Public Transport Accessibility Scores (PTALs)\nEnvironment\n - Access to public open space & nature\nHappiness\n - Composite Subjective Well-being Score (Life Satisfaction, Worthwhileness, Anxiety, and Happiness) (New data only available since 2011/12)\nWith some measures if the data shows a high figure that indicates better well-being, and with other measures a low figure indicates better well-being. Therefore scores for Life Expectancy, GCSE scores, PTALs, and Access to Public Open Space/Nature have been reversed so that in all measures low scores indicate probable lower well-being.\nThe data has been turned into scores where each indicator in each year has a standard deviation of 10. This means that each indicator will have an equal effect on the final score when the weightings are set to equal.\nWhy should measuring well-being be important to policy makers? \n Following research by the Cabinet Office and Office for National Statistics, the government is aiming to develop policy that is more focused on ‘all those things that make life worthwhile’ (David Cameron, November 2010). They are interested in developing new and better ways to understand how policy and public services affect well-being.\nWhy measure well-being for local areas?\n It is important for London policy makers to consider well-being at a local level (smaller than borough level) because of the often huge differences within boroughs. Local authorities rely on small area data in order to target resources, and with local authorities currently gaining more responsibilities from government, this is of increasing importance. But small area data is also of interest to academics, independent analysts and members of the public with an interest in the subject of well-being.\nHow can well-being be measured within small areas?\n The Office for National Statistics have been developing new measures of national well-being, and as part of this, at a national and regional level, the ONS has published some subjective data to measure happiness. ONS have not measured well-being for small areas, so this tool has been designed to fill this gap. However, DCLG have published a tool that models life satisfaction data for LSOAs based on a combination of national level happiness data, and 'ACORN' data. Happiness data is not available for small areas because there are no surveys large enough for this level of detail, and so at this geography the focus is on objective indicators. Data availability for small areas is far more limited than for districts, and this means the indicators that the scores are based on are not all perfect measures of well-being, though they are the best available. However, by using a relatively high number of measures across a number of years, this increases the reliability of the well-being scores.\nHow can this tool be used to help policy makers?\n Each neighbourhood will have its own priorities, but the data in this tool could help provide a solid evidence base for informed local policy-making, and the distribution of regeneration funds. In addition, it could assist users to identify the causes behind an improvement in well-being in certain wards, where examples of good practice could be applied elsewhere.\nDifferences to the previous report\nThis is the 2013 edition of this publication, and there is one change from 2012. Indicators of Election turnout has been replaced with a composite score of subjective well-being indicators.\nPast versions are still available for 2011 and 2012. The rationale/methodology paper from 2011 is here. The scores from the 2012 spreadsheet are also available in PDF format. The scores in Intelligence Update 21-2012 are based on equal weightings across each measure.\nThis tool was created by the GLA Intelligence Unit.

Wave three, to be launched in January 2022, will be open to a wider group of stakeholders and focus specifically on organisations supporting Afghans living temporarily in bridging hotels. The results are being used to contribute to the collective understanding of the needs of Afghan arrivals in our city. \nThe cohort is being recruited using existing contacts held by the Greater London Authority, and ‘snowball’ sampling, i.e. organisations are asked to forward the invitation to participate to other organisations known to them. Recruitment to the survey is being kept open to enable new organisations to join as they begin to engage with the community.\nThe information contained in these reports should be considered indicative only and may not be fully representative of all civil society or statutory organisations in London. Nor can the findings be considered representative of individual boroughs, as many organisations work across multiple boroughs. However, alongside other intelligence, we hope the information will be useful.  \nIf your organisation is supporting Afghans living temporarily in bridging hotels in London and would like to take part in this survey, please click here. \n",

            "summary": "These fuel poverty risk indicators provide users with a nuanced picture of the impact of various risk factors, exacerbating factors and indicators for fuel poverty. It was developed with the Assembly Health and Public Services Committee in their investigation into fuel poverty in London. The Committee's report explains how the tool could be used strategically to help organisations target specific wards that are at high risk of fuel poverty. Appendix 4 in the report set out the rationale for the risk factors present in the tool.\nUsers can adjust the weighting of the indicators to show their relative significance. Isolating specific indicators could help organisations determine what type of support is likely to have greatest impact in an area. For example, wards with a low score for cavity wall insulation would indicate wards that could be targeted for promoting uptake of cavity wall insulation.\nRead Victoria Borwick's blog \"Using public data to tackle fuel poverty - can you help?\"\nThe fuel poverty scores measure risk of fuel poverty based on 12 indicators. The England and Wales average each year is 0. Scores below 0 are more likely to be at risk from fuel poverty according to these measures.\nThe indicators are:\nHousing  Dwellings without central heating Cavity walls that are uninsulated Lofts with less than 150mm insulation\nHealth  Health Deprivation & Disability domain (ID2010) Standardised Mortality Ratio Incapacity Benefit claimant rate\nOlder people  People aged 60 and over Older people claiming pension credit\nWorklessness  Unemployment\nPoverty Income Support claimant rate Child Poverty rates Households classified 'fuel poor'\nThe Excel tool includes a ward map, charts and rankings.\nNote: Users must enable macros when prompted upon opening the spreadsheet (or reset security to medium/low) for the map to function. The rest of the tool will function without macros.\n",

            "summary": "\nInformation  \n\n\nThese published reports present information from the multi-agency database Combined Homelessness and Information Network (CHAIN), about people seen rough sleeping by outreach teams in London. CHAIN, which is commissioned and funded by the Greater London Authority (GLA) and managed by Homeless Link, represents one of the UK’s most detailed and comprehensive sources of information about rough sleeping. \n\n\nServices that record information on CHAIN include outreach teams, assessment centres, accommodation projects, day centres and other specialist projects. The system allows users to share information about work done with people sleeping rough and about their needs, ensuring that they receive the most appropriate support and that efforts are not duplicated. \n\n\nIn these reports, people are counted as having been seen rough sleeping if they have been encountered by a commissioned outreach worker bedded down on the street, or in other open spaces or locations not designed for habitation, such as doorways, stairwells, parks or derelict buildings. The report does not include people from “hidden homeless” groups such as those “sofa surfing” or living in squats, unless they have also been seen bedded down in one of the settings outlined above. \n\n\nSeparate reports are produced for London as a whole and for individual boroughs, and these are published each quarter. There are also annual reports that contain aggregated information for each full year. \n\n\nInteractive Visualisation Tool \n\n\nQuarterly Data Tool\n\n\nAnnual Data Tool\n\n\nA suite of online interactive charts and maps based on CHAIN data is available by clicking the above links. The data available via these tools mirrors that presented in the published PDF documents, with the addition of filters and other enhancements to allow users to interrogate the data. The Quarterly Data Tool shows data from the last eight quarters, and the Annual Data Tool shows data from the last five years.  \n\n\nOrganisations Using CHAIN  \n\n\nA list of the  organisations which have signed the CHAIN Data Protection Agreement  and are able to access the live CHAIN system is also available to download. \n\n\nPDF Reports & Data tables \n\n\nAs of January 2024, published CHAIN PDF reports are accompanied by an OpenDocument Spreadsheet file providing the underlying data in an accessible aggregated tabular format.

            "summary": "\nIntroduction\n\n\nThe GiGL Spaces to Visit dataset provides locations and boundaries for open space sites in Greater London that are available to the public as destinations for leisure, activities and community engagement. It includes green corridors that provide opportunities for walking and cycling.\n\n\nThe dataset has been created by Greenspace Information for Greater London CIC (GiGL). As London’s Environmental Records Centre, GiGL mobilises, curates and shares data that underpin our knowledge of London’s natural environment. We provide impartial evidence to support informed discussion and decision making in policy and practice. \n\n\nGiGL maps under licence from the Greater London Authority. \n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThis dataset is a sub-set of the   GiGL Open Space dataset, the most comprehensive dataset available of open spaces in London. Sites are selected for inclusion in Spaces to Visit based on their public accessibility and likelihood that people would be interested in visiting.\nThe dataset is a mapped Geographic Information System (GIS) polygon dataset where one polygon (or multi-polygon) represents one space. As well as site boundaries, the dataset includes information about a site’s name, size and type (e.g. park, playing field etc.).\nGiGL developed the Spaces to Visit dataset to support anyone who is interested in London’s open spaces - including community groups, web and app developers, policy makers and researchers - with an open licence data source. More detailed and extensive data are available under GiGL data use licences for GIGL partners, researchers and students. Information services are also available for ecological consultants, biological recorders and community volunteers – please see www.gigl.org.uk for more information.\nPlease note that access and opening times are subject to change (particularly at the current time) so if you are planning to visit a site check on the local authority or site website that it is open.\nThe dataset is updated on a quarterly basis. If you have questions about this dataset please contact GiGL’s GIS and Data Officer.\n\nData sources\n\n\nThe boundaries and information in this dataset, are a combination of data collected during the London Survey Method habitat and open space survey programme (1986 – 2008) and information provided to GiGL from other sources since. These sources include London borough surveys, land use datasets, volunteer surveys, feedback from the public, park friends’ groups, and updates made as part of GiGL’s on-going data validation and verification process. \n\n\nDue to data availability, some areas are more up-to-date than others. We are continually working on updating and improving this dataset. If you have any additional information or corrections for sites included in the Spaces to Visit dataset please contact  GiGL’s GIS and Data Officer.\nNOTE: The dataset contains OS data © Crown copyright and database rights 2024. The site boundaries are based on Ordnance Survey mapping, and the data are published under Ordnance Survey's 'presumption to publish'. When using these data please acknowledge GiGL and Ordnance Survey as the source of the information using the following citation:\n\n‘Dataset created by Greenspace Information for Greater London CIC (GiGL), 2024 – Contains Ordnance Survey and public sector information licensed under the   Open Government Licence v3.0  ’\n",
