Summary: Since 2006 the GLA Group has been implementing the London Living Wage (LLW).The Group continues to include the LLW as a requirement for contracts that are let or renewed.\nWe calculate the Living Wage by a combination of two approaches. The first, developed by the Family Budget Unit (FBU), estimates the costs of a ‘Low Cost but Acceptable’ (LCA) budget for a selection of households and calculates the wage required to meet these costs. This is termed the “Basic Living Costs” approach. The second – the “Income Distribution” approach – simply identifies the median income for London (appropriately weighted for 11 household types) and then takes 60 per cent of it.\nThe Mayor continues to lobby national Government to adopt the London Living Wage across Whitehall.\nAll annual living wage reports, titled 'A Fairer London', can be found on the GLA website..

Summary: Updated in Februrary 2017.\nAir quality in London has improved in recent years as a result of policies to reduce emissions, primarily from road transport. However, recently updated maps of pollution concentrations for 2013 (LAEI 2013) still show significant areas of exceedances of the annual mean NO2 EU Limit Values. Improvements are planned to address these, as recently announced in the Mayor’s package of air quality measures.\n\nThe Updated Analysis of Air Pollution Exposure in London research provides an update to similar analysis undertaken in 2013 (which looked at pollution exposure in 2010), published recently by City Hall. It examines pollution exposure in London in 2013 and considers how exposure varies by indicators of age, relative deprivation and ethnic groups in London. It also looks at total exposure (broken down by borough) and exposure at schools.   Through the research described in this report, City Hall is seeking to understand the inequalities in accessing clean air in London and considering how this will be improved by planned air pollution policies.\nThe spreadsheet lists the schools located in areas where average concentrations of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) are over the legal and safe limit as defined by the EU Limit Values; the Limit Value is 40 μg/m3. The modelled NO2 data used in this report is from the 2013 London Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (LAEI), and the list of schools used is from Edubase public portal from the Department of Education.  The list is shown by borough and in descending order with the most polluted first. Further analysis of this data and other indications of the links between air pollution and social gradient in London can be found in the Updated Analysis of Air Pollution Exposure in London.\n.

As an employee, Apprentices earn as they learn and gain practical skills in the workplace.\nAn Apprenticeship framework contains the following separately certified elements. • A knowledge-based element (the theoretical knowledge underpinning a job in a certain occupation and industry, typically certified via a Technical Certificate). • A competence-based element (the ability to discharge the functions of a certain occupation, typically certified via work-based assessed national vocational qualifications - NVQs). • Transferable skills (literacy and numeracy) - key skills / functional skills. • A module on employment rights and responsibilities.\nThis table shows provisional estimates for 2010/11. It is not possible to directly compare provisional 2010/11 estimates with figures for previous years.\nVolumes are rounded to the nearest ten except for England Total and Grand Total which are rounded to the nearest hundred.\nUnlike participation figures, figures for 2008/09 onwards are comparable with earlier years as demand led funding rules are not applied to starts.\nFull-year numbers are a count of the number of starts at any point during the year. Learners starting more than one framework will appear more than once.\nProgramme-Led Apprenticeships recorded in WBL ILR returns are included in the figures.\nGovernment Office Region and Local Authority are based upon the home postcode of the learner.\nThese figures are based on the geographic boundaries of local authorities as of May 2010. Figures for 2010/11 are based on postcode to geographic area assignments in the National Statistics Postcode Lookup. Figures for earlier years are based on the Office for National Statistics Postcode Directory. Figures for 2003/04 to 2008/09 based on earlier geographic boundaries are available in the SFR Archive, but these cannot be directly compared with new figures due to boundary changes.\nThe years given refer to academic years starting from August.\nDownload the data from The Skills Funding Agency.\n\n\n\n\nThis dataset is one of the Greater London Authority's measures of Economic Fairness.

This new plan, plus the Assessment of Risk which supports, it are available on the LFB website here.\nThe 2017 Assessment of Local Risk was a public facing document, designed to help increase the understanding of how risk (from fire and other emergencies) in London has changed over time and how different elements combine together to give a picture of risk.\nThe AoLR 2017 was not the only process the LFB uses to determine and provide its services, but it does give a high level overview which can be used to understand the basic concepts of fire cover and the steps the LFB are taking to make people safe.\nThe Brigade sets out how its prevention, protection and response activities will best be used to mitigate the impact of risk on communities in its Integrated Risk Management Plan (IRMP). The Brigade’s IRMP was formerly known as the London Safety Plan (LSP). The LSP 2017 originally covered the four year period from April 2017 to March 2021 (but was extended to 31 March 2023) and is available here. Previous LSPs are available on the LFB web site here. The methodology used for the Assessment of Risk was reviewed and updated as part of the preparation for the new Community Risk Management Plan (CRMP) which runs from April 2023.\nWard level data is also published on this page for the 2017 AoLR (in XLS and CSV formats).

Summary: Revised details of the level of council tax set by local authorities in England for 2012-13 were announced on 9 May 2012.\nCouncil tax can be measured in ‘Band D’ or in ‘per dwelling’ terms. Band D has historically been used as the standard for comparing council tax levels between and across local authorities, as this measure is not affected by the varying distribution of properties in bands that can be found across authorities. Additionally, the number of Band D equivalent dwellings are collected at around the same time that the council tax levels are set by the local authority, whereas the ‘per dwelling’ calculation uses chargeable dwellings figures that are captured some five months in advance of setting council tax levels. The Band D measure therefore better reflects the latest position.\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/collections/council-tax-statistics\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/live-tables-on-council-tax.

Summary: The GLA strongly believes that Government needs to do more to unlock the power of data, helping organisations to make better decisions and operate more efficiently. Greater sharing of information between public authorities will allow them to improve the lives of citizens and help the economy flourish. To this end, in March 2016, the GLA launched the London City Data Strategy. The aim of this strategy is to give London the most dynamic and productive city data market in the world by reducing friction in the sharing and value-driven exploitation of city data to a minimum. The GLA seeks to recognise city data as part of the capital’s infrastructure, using it to save money, incubate innovation, and drive economic growth, helping London to achieve global renown for data impact. Within this Strategy, we have committed to - as a priority action - pushing for broad access to data across government departments e.g. HMRC and DWP) for London, to overcome issues which currently prevent further data sharing opportunities outside departmental silos and which stand in the way of value creation. .

Summary: \nDataset last updated: 8th January 2025\n\nThis dataset provides indicative areas of biodiversity hotspots in Greater London, identified by research and data analysis using methods derived from the Greater London Authority’s (GLA) “Planning for Biodiversity?” report (2016).\nThe dataset has been created by Greenspace Information for Greater London CIC (GiGL). GiGL mobilises, curates and shares data that underpin our knowledge of London’s natural environment. We provide impartial evidence to enable informed discussion and decision-making in policy and practice. The dataset is based on GiGL partnership data which are continuously updated.\nThe underlying data for the dataset may have been subject to changes since the current version was modelled. Subsequent versions will provide updated information from the GiGL database annually. The dataset is a coarse-resolution presentation of high-resolution data. To access data at their original resolution, please contact GiGL or visit www.gigl.org.uk for more information.\nResearch for this dataset has been assisted by London and South East England Local Records Centres (LaSER) and the London Boroughs Biodiversity Forum (LBBF), and is based on advice provided by the Open Data Institute (ODI).\n\n\n\nDescription\nTo meet Policy G6 D of The London Plan (2021), the capital’s spatial development strategy, \" Development proposals should manage impacts on biodiversity and aim to secure net biodiversity gain. This should be informed by the best available ecological information and addressed from the start of the development process\".\n\nThe Biodiversity Hotspots for Planning (BHP) dataset provides developers, homeowners and LPAs an indication of areas, where data are available, that have potential impacts on biodiversity and are likely to be relevant to local planning decisions by applying biodiversity criteria developed by GiGL, based on the original “Planning for Biodiversity?” research. ‘Hotspot’ areas indicate a detected presence of sensitive biodiversity that could potentially be affected by development. Original records can be accessed from GiGL to assist the decision-making process.\n\nN.B. 1: Areas without these biodiversity indicator records may still have undetected biodiversity so should also be considered for biodiversity potential on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\nN.B. 2: The dataset is purely indicative and an ecological data search report must still be commissioned as evidence for planning applications. See  here  for help on this.\n\n\n\n\nSpecification\nThe GIS file shows London as 100m hexagon tiles. Each tile is scored for the known presence of protected species, sites and habitats impact areas based on the impact buffer size as specified in the criteria table below, giving a cumulative score range of 0 to 3. Tiles are considered a hotspot where impact areas overlap the tile by more than 10%.\n\n\n\nTiles with a score of 0 indicate that there are currently no known protected species, sites or habitats impact areas present in that area based on the criteria table, which excludes some protected species. Tiles with a score of 3 indicate the presence of impact areas for all three categories. Intermediate scores indicate the presence of impact areas for one or more of the categories without specifying which are present. The scores can be used in a thematic map to colour the tiles and visually indicate areas with greater presence of impact areas. A sample thematic map is provided.\nThe dataset will be updated annually using the latest protected species, sites and habitats data available to GiGL at time of creation.

Every time a birth is registered in England and Wales both parents\nare required to state their places of birth on their child's birth\ncertificate, and this information is then collated to produce these\nstatistics.\nIn order to make it easier to look at what these data tell us about\nbirths in London, and how these have been changing over time, the GLA\nDemography team has extracted the data which relate to London from the\nmain ONS dataset since 2001 and presented it here in an easily\naccessible format.\nFor more information about how the ONS produces these statistics, please\nvisit their website:\nhttps://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths\nFor more information about how we extracted these data and created this\nreport, please this project's Github repository:\nhttps://github.com/Greater-London-Authority/births_by_mothers_country_of_birth\n \n\n \nSince 2001, the number of live births being recorded in London has\nchanged from 104,162 to 104,246 births per year. The proportion of\nbirths which were to mothers who had been born outside the UK has\nchanged from 43% in 2001 to 59% in the most recent year (2023).\nIn 2023, the region of origin which supplied the largest number of\nbirths to non-UK-born mothers in London was Asia with 24,004, followed\nby the Africa which provided 10,596. The region of origin which has seen\nthe largest change since 2001 is the Asia, which went from 13,489 live\nbirths per year in 2001 to 24,004 in 2023.\n \n\n \nIn 2023, the region with the largest number of births to non-UK-born\nmothers was London with 61,357 live births (59% of all live births in\nLondon). By contrast, the region with the lowest number of births to\nnon-UK-born mothers was the Wales with 3,891 live births to non-UK-born\nmothers, which only represented 14% of all live births in that region.\nThe data shows that London accounted for 33% of all the births to\nnon-UK-born mothers in England and Wales in 2023, which was a far higher\nproportion than any other region.\nThese data also highlight a couple of other interesting comparisons.\nFirstly, despite being the second largest region in England and Wales in\nterms of population, London is not the region with the largest number of\nbirths to UK-born mothers. Secondly, London is the only region to have\nrelatively large numbers of mothers from every region of the world\naccording to the way in which the ONS has categorised them, including\nAfrica, non-EU European countries (such as Turkey and Russia) and the\n'Rest of the World' (which includes the Americas and Oceania).\nThe data comparing London with England & Wales excluding London and\nEngland & Wales as a whole (including London) is provided in the table\nbelow:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Births - UK Mothers\n\n\nTotal Births - Overseas Mothers\n\n\nPre-2004 EU countries\n\n\nPost-2004 EU accession countries\n\n\nRest of Europe\n\n\nAsia\n\n\nAfrica\n\n\nRest of the world\n\n\n\n\nYear\n\n\nRegion\n\n\nNo. \n\n\n%\n\n\nNo. \n\n\n%\n\n\nNo. \n\n\n%\n\n\nNo. \n\n\n%\n\n\nNo. \n\n\n%\n\n\nNo. \n\n\n%\n\n\nNo. \n\n\n%\n\n\nNo. \n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2023\n\n\nLondon\n\n\n42,889\n\n\n41%\n\n\n61,357\n\n\n59%\n\n\n6,505\n\n\n6%\n\n\n8,265\n\n\n8%\n\n\n5,985\n\n\n6%\n\n\n24,004\n\n\n23%\n\n\n10,596\n\n\n10%\n\n\n6,002\n\n\n6%\n\n\n\n\n2023\n\n\nRest of England & Wales\n\n\n360,109\n\n\n74%\n\n\n126,540\n\n\n26%\n\n\n10,590\n\n\n2%\n\n\n26,464\n\n\n5%\n\n\n6,587\n\n\n1%\n\n\n49,668\n\n\n10%\n\n\n26,014\n\n\n5%\n\n\n7,217\n\n\n1%\n\n\n\n\n2023\n\n\nEngland & Wales\n\n\n402,998\n\n\n68%\n\n\n187,897\n\n\n32%\n\n\n17,095\n\n\n3%\n\n\n34,729\n\n\n6%\n\n\n12,572\n\n\n2%\n\n\n73,672\n\n\n12%\n\n\n36,610\n\n\n6%\n\n\n13,219\n\n\n2%\n\n\n\n\n \nBirths by Mother's Country of Birth by London Borough\n\n\n\n\n.

This indicator includes all births.\n3) Percentage of live births with birthweights under 2500 grams since 1999.The percentage of low birthweight live births is calculated as the number of low birthweight live births divided by the total number of live births where birthweight is stated, and expressed as a percentage. This indicator is no longer being updated.\nAllocation to geographical area is based on mother’s place of usual residence.\nAn association has also been shown between low birth weight and adverse health in later childhood and adulthood.\nLow birthweight is an enduring aspect of childhood morbidity, a major factor in infant mortality and has serious consequences for health in later life (NICE). There are social inequalities in low birthweight in England and Wales and these inequalities are likely to affect childhood and adult health inequalities in the future, hence strategies will need to address differences in low birthweight and further monitoring of trends is therefore desirable (Moser K, Li L, and Power C, Social inequalities in low birthweight in England and Wales: trends and implications for future population health, Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health 2003).\nBirths for the City of London have been included with those for Hackney.\nData for term babies from the PHOF, data for all babies from NHS IC. \nMap image here..

Summary: The Breathe London stationary network is made up of 100 AQMesh pods, each containing a collection of small sensor-based air quality monitors that offer near real-time localised air quality information. They measure nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) and nitric oxide (NO) using electrochemical sensors; particulate matter (PM) in various size cuts (PM₂.₅ and PM10 are reported) using a light-scattering optical particle counter; and carbon dioxide (CO₂) using a non-dispersive infrared absorbance sensor. In some locations, the pods measure ozone (O3), also using electrochemical sensors. The pods measure temperature, humidity and air pressure for the purposes of correction for environmental conditions. Each sensor pod is set up to collect data continuously for 10-second intervals and to create an average every 1-15 minutes, synchronised to the top of each hour.\nMore information can be found on the Breathe London website..

Pollutants measured include black carbon (BC), CO₂, NO, NO₂, O3, PM2.5 (and other PM size ranges) on a variety of London roadways. The National Physical Laboratory is responsible for regular checks of instrument performance and periodic calibrations.\nThe cars are collecting data from early morning to late evening, Monday to Friday – providing a representative view of on-road air pollution during these hours. The mobile monitoring routes are sampled at different times of day, days of week and time of year – with a target of achieving a minimum of approximately 15 passes of each route over the course of the study (however, traffic congestion and other factors may reduce this number).\nMore information can be found on the Breathe London website..

Summary: The GLA have produced updates to the tree canopy cover and green cover assessments previously produced in November 2018 and January 2019 respectively (based on 2016 data). \nThe 2024 updates are based on data primarily from 2022 and estimate London’s tree canopy cover at 19.6% (±0.3%) and its green cover at 51.7% (±1.11%). \nThese estimates were produced via a ‘machine learning’ computer modelling technique that uses algorithms to assess source data (colour aerial imagery, infrared aerial imagery, and height data) to make a judgement about what is tree canopy or other green cover (vegetation that is not trees). The approach makes use of the fact that vegetation reflects infrared light and enables the modelling of all of London’s green infrastructure, not just the elements that are accessible for on-the-ground surveying.  \nThis page hosts the results of the canopy cover assessment, while another Datastore page hosts the results of the green cover assessment. \nMore information is available within the methodology report below and resulting cover estimates (%) are provided here by borough and ward.

This is a new classification produced using the same principles but a different statistical methodology from that used to produce the other area classifications.\r\n\nThis data package presents the data for the 24,140 Census Output Areas in Greater London but data for the UK is also available (see Download URL below). \r\n\nFor further guidance, advice and to see case studies using the 2001 OAC data, visit the OAC User Groups website: http://areaclassification.org.uk/\n\nIf you have any queries about or problems accessing any of the data please let Leeds University know: E-mail comments or queries to d.vickers@sheffield.ac.uk or visit their website.\r\n\n*Please note that the Output Area cluster names (e.g. 'City Living') are not a national statistic and endorsed by ONS, these have been created and added by the University of Leeds to add further meaning to the classification.\r\n.

It can be used to review job and business data for each CEZ, as well as several other creative areas across London.\nAbout the data\nSectors\nThe data relates specifically to creative sector SIC codes (standard industrial classification) as defined by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). The list of SIC codes is provided in the repository below (activity_subsector_sic.csv).\nSources\n\nJob counts are from the ONS Business Register & Employment Survey. Job counts are estimated through a survey of a sample businesses throughout the country. The survey takes place annually in September. Job data is currently only available up to the 2021 survey. The data only counts employees; it does not include sole traders/freelancers.\n\nBusiness counts are from the ONS UK Business Counts. The count is based on active businesses and takes place annually in March. Business data is available up to the 2022 survey. Freelancers/sole traders may be included in these counts if they are registered with Companies House (e.g. as a limited company) at an address within the relevant creative area.\nNote that because of the difference in survey months, there may be a lag between job and business trends. For example, job counts taken in 2020 (September) will likely be lower than previous years because they will be affected by Covid-19 related job losses, whereas business counts taken in 2020 (March) will likely not show major fluctuation from previous years because the Covid-19 related impacts won't yet have registered.\n\nTurnover and births & deaths information comes from ONS Interdepartmental Business Register (IDBR). Because of data suppression, it is only available down to local authority level. The data has been scaled to estimate the amount of turnover, births, and deaths per creative area. For example, if a borough has 500 creative businesses producing 50m turnover, we would average 100k turnover per business. If the creative area in that borough has 100 creative businesses, 100 x 100,000 in turnover = 10m throughout the creative area.\nFor CEZ across two or more authorities, we have used the sum of turnover/births/deaths in the composite authorities as the basis for calculation.\nNote that subsector or activity counts for births/deaths may not add up to the figures in the total births/deaths data due to rounding.\nAs a result, data on turnover, births & deaths should be treated as broad estimates only.\n\n\nGeographies\n\n\nJob counts and business counts relate to the best-fit middle super output areas (MSOAs) for the boundary of each Creative Enterprise Zone. The MSOAs have been agreed with CEZ managers.\n\nTurnover and births & deaths have been scaled from local authority-level data to the MSOAs above.\nThe list of MSOAs is provided in the repository below (cez_msoas.csv).\nGuide to spreadsheets\nThe spreadsheets below provide various configurations of the job and business counts, turnover, and births & deaths data.\nBreakdowns are provided for area and aggregate data:\n\nArea data relates to individual creative areas (i.e. individual Creative Enterprise Zones and non-CEZ comparison areas)\nAggregate data relates to collections of creative areas (e.g. all CEZ areas, all comparator areas)\n\nFor both area and aggregate data, the following configurations are provided per year (listed from most general to most granular):\n\nHeadline data\nActivities (i.e. consumption or production)\nSubsectors (e.g. architecture, photography)\nActivities x subsectors (e.g. consumption - screen and digital, production - screen and digital)\nSpecific subsectors by 5-digit SIC code (job and business counts only)\n\nGuide to Creative Enterprise Zones data explorer\nThe data has been built into an interactive explorer for quick visualisation and analysis, which is available here. The explorer takes around five seconds to load initially and works best on a laptop or desktop (not mobile). Tips for using the explorer:\n\n2022 data is currently only available for business counts\nExport any of the graphs as a .png using the small icon in the top-right of a graph\nIn the subsector graphs, single-click a legend item to remove it from the graph, or double-click a legend item to only show that item on the graph\n.

Summary: \nInformation  \n\n\nThese published reports present information from the multi-agency database Combined Homelessness and Information Network (CHAIN), about people seen rough sleeping by outreach teams in London. CHAIN, which is commissioned and funded by the Greater London Authority (GLA) and managed by Homeless Link, represents one of the UK’s most detailed and comprehensive sources of information about rough sleeping. \n\n\nServices that record information on CHAIN include outreach teams, assessment centres, accommodation projects, day centres and other specialist projects. The system allows users to share information about work done with people sleeping rough and about their needs, ensuring that they receive the most appropriate support and that efforts are not duplicated. \n\n\nIn these reports, people are counted as having been seen rough sleeping if they have been encountered by a commissioned outreach worker bedded down on the street, or in other open spaces or locations not designed for habitation, such as doorways, stairwells, parks or derelict buildings. The report does not include people from “hidden homeless” groups such as those “sofa surfing” or living in squats, unless they have also been seen bedded down in one of the settings outlined above. \n\n\nSeparate reports are produced for London as a whole and for individual boroughs, and these are published each quarter. There are also annual reports that contain aggregated information for each full year. \n\n\nInteractive Visualisation Tool \n\n\nQuarterly Data Tool\n\n\nAnnual Data Tool\n\n\nA suite of online interactive charts and maps based on CHAIN data is available by clicking the above links. The data available via these tools mirrors that presented in the published PDF documents, with the addition of filters and other enhancements to allow users to interrogate the data. The Quarterly Data Tool shows data from the last eight quarters, and the Annual Data Tool shows data from the last five years.  \n\n\nOrganisations Using CHAIN  \n\n\nA list of the  organisations which have signed the CHAIN Data Protection Agreement  and are able to access the live CHAIN system is also available to download. \n\n\nPDF Reports & Data tables \n\n\nAs of January 2024, published CHAIN PDF reports are accompanied by an OpenDocument Spreadsheet file providing the underlying data in an accessible aggregated tabular format.

Child Benefit is paid to those responsible for children (aged under 16) or qualifying young people. The latter includes:\na) those in full-time non-advanced education or (from April 2006) on certain approved vocational training courses and who are under 19, or are aged 19 and have been on the same course since their 19th birthdays. (Note: those reaching 19 up to 9 April 2006 ceased to qualify on their 19th birthdays);\nb) those entered for future external examinations, or are in the period between leaving education (or exams finishing) and the week containing the first Monday in September (or similar dates after Easter and in early January, if earlier), and are not in work (there are slight variations for Scotland);\nc) those aged under 18 who have moved directly from full-time education to being registered for work or training with the Careers service or with Connexions.\nAs of January 2013, claimants may be liable to a tax charge called the 'High Income Child Benefit charge'. Being liable for this charge does not affect a claimant's eligibility but any Child Benefit recipient is liable to repay some or all of their Child Benefit back if they or their partner has an individual income of more than £50,000 per year. For every additional £100 over the £50,000 threshold that an individual earns, the tax charge due increases by 1%. This means that any recipient whose income (or partner’s income) is over £60,000 will be liable to repay their entire Child Benefit entitlement. Alternatively, claimants affected by the High Income Child Benefit charge have the option to opt-out of receiving Child Benefit, thereby ceasing their payments.\nChild benefit data for Lower Super Output Areas (LSOA) can be accessed on the HMRC website.\nRelated to: https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/child-benefit-geographical-statistics.

Summary: About the dataset\nThis dataset uses information from the DWP benefit system to provide estimates of children living in poverty for wards in London. In order to be counted in this dataset, a family must have claimed Child Benefit and at least one other household benefit (Universal Credit, tax credits or Housing Benefit) during the year. The numbers are calibrated to the Households Below Average Income (HBAI) dataset used to provide the government's headline poverty statistics. The definition of relative low income is living in a household with equivalised* income before housing costs (BHC) below 60% of contemporary national median income. The income measure includes contributions from earnings, state support and pensions.\nFurther detail on the estimates of dependent children living in relative low income, including alternative geographical breakdowns and additional variables, such as age of children, family type and work status are available from DWP's statistical tabulation tool Stat-Xplore. Minor adjustments to the data have been applied to guard against the identification of individual claimants.\nThis dataset replaced the DWP children in out-of-work benefit households and HMRC children in low income families local measure releases.\nThis dataset includes estimates for all wards in London of numbers of dependent children living in relative low income families for each financial year from 2014/15 to the latest available (2022/23). The figures for the latest year are provisional and are subject to minor revision when the next dataset is released by DWP.\n\n\n\nHeadlines\n\nNumber of children\n\nThe number of dependent children living in relative low income across London, rose from below 310,000 in the financial year ending 2015 to over 420,000 in the financial year ending 2020, but has decreased since then to below 350,000, which is well below the number for financial year ending 2018. While many wards in London have followed a similar pattern, the numbers of children in low income families in some wards have fallen more sharply, while the numbers in other wards have continued to grow.\n\nProportion of children in each London ward\n\nWard population sizes vary across London, the age profile of that population also varies and both the size and make-up of the population can change over time, so in order to make more meaningful comparisons between wards or over time, DWP have also published rates, though see note below regarding caution when using these figures.\nA dependent child is anyone aged under 16; or aged 16 to 19 in full-time non-advanced education or in unwaged government training. Ward level estimates for the total number of dependent children are not available, so percentages cannot be derived. Ward level estimates for the percentage of children under 16 living in low income families are usually published by DWP but, in its latest release, ward-level population estimates were not available at the time, so no rates were published. To derive the rates in this dataset, the GLA has used the ONS's latest ward-level population estimates (official statistics in development). Percentages for 2021/22 are calculated using the 2021 mid year estimates, while percentages for 2022/23 are calculated using the 2022 mid year estimates. As these are official statistics in development, rates therefore need to be treated with some caution.\n\nNotes\n\n*equivalised income is adjusted for household size and composition in order to compare living standards between households of different types..

        "embedding_text": "Title: Climate Risk Mapping. Summary: A series of London-wide climate risk maps has been produced to analyse climate exposure and vulnerability across Greater London. These maps were produced by Bloomberg Associates in collaboration with the Greater London Authority to help the GLA and other London-based organisations deliver equitable responses to the impacts of climate change and target resources to support communities at highest risk.\nClimate vulnerability relates to people’s exposure to climate impacts like flooding or heatwaves, but also to personal and social factors that affect their ability to cope with and respond to extreme events. High climate risk coincides with areas of income and health inequalities. A series of citywide maps overlays key metrics to identify areas within London that are most exposed to climate impacts with high concentrations of vulnerable populations.\nIn 2022, Bloomberg Associates updated London’s climate risk maps to include additional data layers at a finer geographic scale (LSOA boundaries). These maps were built upon earlier maps using the Transport for London (Tfl) hexagonal grid (often referred to in this report as the “Hex Grid”). In addition, the map interface was updated to allow users to compare individual data layers to the Overall, Heat and Flooding Climate Risk maps. Users can now also see the specific metrics for each individual LSOA to understand which factors are driving risk throughout the city. \nIn 2024, Bloomberg Associates further modernized the climate risk maps by updating the social factor layers to employ more recent (2021) census data. In addition, air temperature at the surface was used in place of just surface temperature, as a more accurate assessment of felt heat.\nThe Mayor is addressing these climate risks and inequalities through the work of the London Recovery Board, which includes projects and programmes to address climate risks and ensure a green recovery from the pandemic. Ambitious policies in the London Environment Strategy and recently published new London Plan are also addressing London’s climate risks.\nThe data layers at the LSOA level are available here to use in GIS software:\nClimate risk scores (overall, heat, and flood): https://cityhall.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=22484ef240624e149735ca1aaa4c9ade#\nSocial and physical risk variables: https://cityhall.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=bc06d80731f146b393f8631a0f98c213#.

To better understand the issues, in October 2017 the GLA has undertaken a customer experience survey of residents of housing developments in London whose heating arrangements incorporate a communal heating system / on-site district heating network supplied by CHP. This has involved schemes installed both pre- and post-London Plan (2009). A total of 384 responses were gained from 44 sites across London.\n\n\n\nThe survey conclusions have been contrasted with those of similar recent studies carried out by other organisations. The BEIS Heat Network Consumer Survey (2017) and this survey both conclude that heat customers served by communal heating systems and heat networks, including CHP, are generally satisfied with their heating arrangements..

Summary: \nICF Consulting Services Ltd were commissioned to undertake an Evaluation of The Community Outreach Programme. The evaluation aims to assess the outcomes and impacts of  The Community Outreach Programme  for the 2023-24 period.\n\nThe Community Outreach Programme was designed to enhance adult education and skills provision in London, focusing on underserved communities. The programme funded 28 community organisations with an annual turnover of less than £500,000 to deliver various activities that engage and support Londoners into adult education. The turnover threshold was specifically intended to encourage smaller community organisations to apply. The programme ran between October 2023 and August 2024. Furthermore, the Programme was partly funded by London Multiply to ensure programme activity had a numeracy focus to help reduce negative perceptions and support Londoners to access numeracy provision.\nThe report includes recommendations for future rounds of The Community Outreach Programme and highlights key findings for the GLA to consider. The Mayor/GLA welcomed the key findings from the 2023-24 Community Outreach Programme Evaluation report and have provided a response to 5 key areas for attention in separate paper.  .

This note provides a summary of the key data for London from this release. Data are published through the UK Coronavirus Dashboard, last updated on 23 March 2023.\nThis update contains:\n\nData on the number of cases identified daily through Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 testing at the national, regional and local authority level\nData on the number of people who have been vaccinated against COVID-19\nData on the number of COVID-19 patients in Hospital\nData on the number of people who have died within 28 days of a COVID-19 diagnosis\nData for London and London boroughs and data disaggregated by age group\n\nData on weekly deaths related to COVID-19, published by the Office for National Statistics and NHS, is also available.\nKey Points\n\nOn 23 March 2023 the daily number of people tested positive for COVID-19 in London was reported as 2,775\n\nOn 23 March 2023 it was newly reported that 94 people in London died within 28 days of a positive COVID-19 test\nThe total number of COVID-19 cases identified in London to date is 3,146,752 comprising 15.2 percent of the England total of 20,714,868 cases\nIn the most recent week of complete data (12 March 2023 - 18 March 2023) 2,951 new cases were identified in London, a rate of 33 cases per 100,000 population. This compares with 2,883 cases and a rate of 32 for the previous week\nIn England as a whole, 29,426 new cases were identified in the most recent week of data, a rate of 52 cases per 100,000 population.

For more information see: Coronavirus (COVID-19) in the UK - About the Data.\nCases Data\nUK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) reports new and cumulative cases identified by Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 testing. Pillar 1 testing relates to tests carried out in UKHSA laboratories or NHS Hospitals for those with clinical need, and health and care workers. Pillar 2 testing relates to tests carried out on the wider population in Lighthouse laboratories, public, private, and academic sector laboratories or using lateral flow devices.\nThe cases data is published by day for Countries within the UK, and Regions, Upper Tier Local Authority (UTLA) and Lower Tier Local Authority (LTLA) within England. The data used here is taken from the regional and UTLA level cases data.\nNotice: Changes to COVID-19 case reporting\nAs of 31 January 2022, UKHSA moved all COVID-19 case reporting in England to use an episode-based definition which includes possible reinfections.\nThose testing positive beyond 90 days of a previous infection are now counted as a separate infection episode (a possible reinfection episode). Previously people who tested positive for COVID-19 were only counted once in case numbers published on the daily dashboard, at the date of the first infection.\nFull details of the changes can be found here\n\nChanges to COVID-19 testing in England\nThe availability of free COVID-19 tests in England changed on 1 April 2022. Information on who can access free tests has been published by UKHSA. Changes to patient testing in the NHS in England have also been published by NHS England.\nDeaths data\nData on COVID-19 associated deaths in England are produced by UKHSA from multiple sources linked to confirmed case data.\nDeaths are only included if the deceased had a positive test for COVID-19 and died within 28 days of the first positive test.\nPostcode of residence for deaths is collected at the time of testing. This is supplemented, where available, with information from ONS mortality records, Health Protection Team reports and NHS Digital Patient Demographic Service records. Full details of the methodology are available in the technical summary of the PHE data series on deaths in people with COVID-19.\nHospital admissions data\nUKHSA publish the daily total number of patients admitted to hospital, patients in hospital and patients in beds which can deliver mechanical ventilation with COVID-19. In England this includes COVID-19 patients being treated in NHS acute hospitals, mental health and learning disability trusts, and independent service providers commissioned by the NHS.\nVaccination data\nUKHSA publish the number of people who have received a COVID-19 vaccination, by day on which the vaccine was administered. Data are reported daily and can be updated for historical dates as vaccinations given are recorded on the relevant system. Therefore, data for recent dates may be incomplete. Vaccinations that were carried out in England are reported in the National Immunisation Management Service which is the system of record for the vaccination programme in England. Only people aged 12 and over who have an NHS number and are currently alive are included. Age is defined as a person's age at 31 August 2021. The data includes counts of vaccinations by age band, dose, region, and local authority.\nAdditional analysis of the vaccine roll out in London can be found here.\nONS population estimates\nThe counts of vaccines given has been converted to percentage of the population vaccinated using the ONS 2020 mid-year population estimates. This is a different population estimate to that used on the UK Coronavirus Dashboard for sub-national data. The UK Coronavirus Dashboard uses people aged 16 and over in the National Immunisation Management Service (NIMS), which is based on GP registrations. In more urban areas like London, NIMS is likely to give an overestimate of the population due to increased population mobility increasing the likelihood duplicate or out of date GP records. Due to the differences in population estimates the percentage of the population vaccinated given here will be higher than the figures included for London on the UK Coronavirus Dashboard..

This compares with 301 and 26 for the previous week.\nThe total number of COVID-19 deaths reported in London hospitals of patients who had tested positive for COVID-19 is now 19,102. The total number of deaths in London hospitals where COVID-19 was mentioned on the death certificate is now 1,590.\nThis compares to figures of 119,237 and 8,197 for English hospitals as a whole.\nDue to the delay between death occurrence and reporting, the estimated number of deaths to this point will be revised upwards over coming days\nThese figures do not include deaths that occurred outside of hospitals. Data from ONS has indicated that the majority (79%) of COVID-19 deaths in London have taken place in hospitals.\n\nRecently announced deaths in Hospitals\n\n\n\n        21 June   22 June   23 June   24 June   25 June   26 June   27 June       London   No positive test   0   0   1   4   0   0   0     London   Positive test   3   7   2   10   0   0   2     Rest of England   No positive test   2   6   4   4   0   0   6     Rest of England   Positive test   47   49   41   58   6   0   81    \n\n        16 May   23 May   30 May   06 June   13 June   20 June   27 June       London   No positive test   14   3   4   0   4   3   5     London   Positive test   45   34   55   20   62   40   24     Rest of England   No positive test   41   58   33   23   47   23   22     Rest of England   Positive test   456   375   266   218   254   261   282    Deaths by date of occurrence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      21 June   22 June   23 June   24 June   25 June   26 June   27 June       London   20,683   20,686   20,690   20,691   20,692   20,692   20,692     Rest of England   106,604   106,635   106,679   106,697   106,713   106,733   106,742    Interpreting the data\nThe data published by NHS England are incomplete due to:\n\ndelays in the occurrence and subsequent reporting of deaths\ndeaths occurring outside of hospitals not being included\n\nThe total deaths reported up to a given point are therefore less than the actual number that have occurred by the same point.\nDelays in reporting\nNHS provide the following guidance regarding the delay between occurrence and reporting of deaths:\nConfirmation of COVID-19 diagnosis, death notification and reporting in central figures can take up to several days and the hospitals providing the data are under significant operational pressure. This means that the totals reported at 5pm on each day may not include all deaths that occurred on that day or on recent prior days.\nThe data published by NHS England for reporting periods from April 1st onward includes both date of occurrence and date of reporting and so it is possible to illustrate the distribution of these reporting delays. This data shows that approximately 10% of COVID-19 deaths occurring in London hospitals are included in the reporting period ending on the same day, and that approximately two-thirds of deaths were reported by two days after the date of occurrence.\n\n\n\nDeaths outside of hospitals\nThe data published by NHS England does not include deaths that occur outside of hospitals, i.e. those in homes, hospices, and care homes.\nONS have published data for deaths by place of occurrence. This shows that, up to 05 August, 79% of deaths in London recorded as involving COVID-19 occurred in hospitals (this compares with 44% for all causes of death). This would suggest that the NHS England data may underestimate overall deaths from COVID-19 by around 20%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Number of deaths   Proportion of deaths     Week ending   Hospital   Care

tested positive for COVID-19, and from 25 April, the number of patients where COVID-19 is mentioned on the death certificate and no positive COVID-19 test result was received. Figures are updated each day at 2pm with deaths reported up to 5pm the previous day. There is a delay between the occurrence of a death to it being captured in the daily reporting. The data can be presented both as reported deaths by day and death occurrences by day. Reported occurrences for recent days should be considered incomplete as likely to be revised upwards as more data becomes available.\nThe location of a death reflects the location of the hospital in which it occurred.\nSource: NHS England COVID-19 Daily Deaths\n\nThe Office for National Statistics publishes deaths for England and Wales by the week in which they were registered. Due to the delay between the occurrence of a death and its registration, many deaths that occur in a given week will appear in the data for a subsequent week. For 2018, ONS estimated that 74% of deaths were registered within seven days. Additional delays in registration can occur over public holidays, with significant changes in numbers being observable over Easter and Christmas.\nThe location of a death reflects the usual residence of the deceased. There are some differences in total numbers reported for different geographical levels. The figures published at the local authority level have been used in this analysis.\nThe data is updated each Tuesday at 9.30am with data for the week ending eleven days prior. For the 2020 series, ONS has included the number of deaths where coronavirus (COVID-19) was mentioned on the death certificate. This data includes deaths for all places of occurrence.\nThe ONS started publishing deaths in care homes notified to the Care Quality Commission on 28th April for local authorities in England by date of notification. This data includes an additional week of data compared to the main ONS publication.\nSource: Deaths registered weekly in England and Wales, provisional, Death registrations and occurrences by local authority, Deaths in care homes notified to the Care Quality Commission, report\n.

Confidence is higher where the results from multiple sources agree more closely. Because the denominator sources are not fully independent of one another, users should interpret the range of values across sources as indicating the minimum range of uncertainty in the true value.\nThe following datasets can be used to estimate vaccine uptake by age group for London:\n\n\nONS 2020 mid-year estimates (MYE). This is the population estimate used for age groups throughout the rest of the analysis.\n\nNumber of people ages 18 and over on the National Immunisation Management Service (NIMS)\n\n\nONS Public Health Data Asset (PHDA) dataset. This is a linked dataset combining the 2011 Census, the General Practice Extraction Service (GPES) data for pandemic planning and research and the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). This data covers a subset of the population.\n\n\n\n\nVaccine roll out in London by Ethnic Group\nUnderstanding how vaccine uptake varies across different ethnic groups in London is complicated by two issues:\n\nEthnicity information for recipients is unavailable for a very large number of the vaccinations that have been delivered. As a result, estimates of vaccine uptake by ethnic group are highly sensitive to the assumptions about and treatment of the Unknown group in calculations of rates.\n\n\n For vaccinations given to people aged 50 and over in London nearly 10% do not have ethnicity information available,\n\nThe accuracy of available population denominators by ethnic group is limited. Because ethnicity information is not captured in official estimates of births, deaths, and migration, the available population denominators typically rely on projecting forward patterns captured in the 2011 Census. Subsequent changes to these patterns, particularly with respect to international migration, leads to increasing uncertainty in the accuracy of denominators sources as we move further away from 2011.\n\nComparing estimated population sizes and implied vaccination rates for multiple sources of denominators provides some indication of uncertainty in the true values. Confidence is higher where the results from multiple sources agree more closely. Because the denominator sources are not fully independent of one another, users should interpret the range of values across sources as indicating the minimum range of uncertainty in the true value.\nThe following population estimates are available by Ethnic group for London:\n\n\nGLA Ethnic group population projections - 2016 as at 2021\n\nONS Population Denominators produced for Race Disparity Audit as at 2018\n\nETHPOP population projections produced by the University of Leeds as at 2020\n\n\n \n\nAntibody prevalence estimates\nAs part of the ONS Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey ONS publish a modelled estimate of the percent of the adult population testing positive for antibodies to Coronavirus by region. Antibodies can be generated by vaccination or previous infection.\n\n\n\nVaccine effects on cases, hospitalisations and deaths\nWhen the vaccine roll out began in December 2020 coronavirus cases, hospital admissions and deaths were rising steeply. The peak of infections came in London in early January 2021, before reducing during the national lockdown and as the vaccine roll out progressed. As the vaccine roll out began in older age groups the effect of vaccinations can be separated from the effect of national lockdown by comparing changes in cases, admissions and deaths in different age groups.\n\n\n\nIn early January, the vast majority of cases were in people aged under 65, however due to the age profile of coronavirus risk, there were more hospital admissions in people aged over 65, and the majority of deaths were also in this group.\nTo more easily compare the changes in cases, admissions and deaths between people aged over and under 65 we can transform the data to represent the number of cases, admissions and deaths as a percentage of the peak value for that age group.\n\n\n\nCase, admission and death rates are now all at much lower rate than they were in the peak of the pandemic, making comparison of recent rates more difficult. By transforming to a log scale any differences between the groups while rates are low will become clearer.\n\n\n\nThe potential vaccine effect of reducing cases and admissions in older age groups prioritised for vaccination compared to younger age groups first appeared after a majority of the most vulnerable group, people aged 80+, were protected by a vaccine dose and has grown in size. As the vaccine coverage increases in younger age groups we'd expect the gap between age groups to reduce. In April and May 2020 deaths from coronavirus were very low in London which makes comparison between age groups difficult.\nWaves compared\nAs restrictions were being lifted in Spring 2021 there has been a subsequent rise in infections in London, similarly to how they rose in September 2020 at the beginning of the second wave.\nHowever, the rise in admissions and deaths in the third wave has been much less than that which followed in Autumn and Winter 2020.\n\n\n\nNotes\nBackground\nFollowing the approval of the Pfizer-Biontec vaccine by the MHRA on 2nd December 2020 the first doses were administered on the 8th December 2020. Since then two further vaccines have been approved and brought into use in the UK, the Oxford University/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines.\nThe JVCI set out the first 9 priority groups for vaccination:\n\nresidents in a care home for older adults and their carers\nall those 80 years of age and over and frontline health and social care workers\nall those 75 years of age and over\nall those 70 years of age and over and clinically extremely vulnerable individuals\nall those 65 years of age and over\nall individuals aged 16 years to 64 years with underlying health conditions which put them at higher risk of serious disease and mortality (including residents in a care home for younger adults)\nall those 60 years of age and over\nall those 55 years of age and over\nall those 50 years of age and over\n\nUnder 50s were offered in age order after vaccine has been offered to all in the 9 priority groups.\nOn 31 December it was announced that vaccines would be administered with a 12 week gap between doses, an increase from the initial advise of a 4 week gap between doses.\nData Sources\nNHS England\nNHS England began publishing data on vaccinations administered on 31 December 2020, with a regional break down first included on 14 January 2021. These statistics include vaccinations administered across all settings in England (Hospital Hubs, Local Vaccination Service sites e.g. GP practices and Vaccination Centres).

Summary: This mapping tool enables you to see how COVID-19 deaths in your area may relate to factors in the local population, which research has shown are associated with COVID-19 mortality.\nIt maps COVID-19 deaths rates for small areas of London (known as MSOAs) and enables you to compare these to a number of other factors including the Index of Multiple Deprivation, the age and ethnicity of the local population, extent of pre-existing health conditions in the local population, and occupational data.\n\n\nResearch has shown that the mortality risk from COVID-19 is higher for people of older age groups, for men, for people with pre-existing health conditions, and for people from BAME backgrounds. London boroughs had some of the highest mortality rates from COVID-19 based on data to April 17th 2020, based on data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Analysis from the ONS has also shown how mortality is also related to socio-economic issues such as occupations classified ‘at risk’ and area deprivation. There is much about COVID-19-related mortality that is still not fully understood, including the intersection between the different factors e.g. relationship between BAME groups and occupation.\nOn their own, none of these individual factors correlate strongly with deaths for these small areas. This is most likely because the most relevant factors will vary from area to area. In some cases it may relate to the age of the population, in others it may relate to the prevalence of underlying health conditions, area deprivation or the proportion of the population working in ‘at risk occupations’, and in some cases a combination of these or none of them.\nFurther descriptive analysis of the factors in this tool can be found here:\n\nhttps://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/covid-19--socio-economic-risk-factors-briefing\n.

Summary: With this add in it is possible to create map templates from GIS files in KML format, and create choropleths with them.\nProviding you have access to KML format map boundary files, it is possible to create your own quick and easy choropleth maps in Excel. The KML format files can be converted from 'shape' files. Many shape files are available to download for free from the web, including from Ordnance Survey and the London Datastore. Standard mapping packages such as QGIS (free to download) and ArcGIS can convert the files to KML format.\nA sample of a KML file (London wards) can be downloaded from this page, so that users can easily test the tool out.\nMacros must be enabled for the tool to function.\nWhen creating the map using the Excel tool, the 'unique ID' should normally be the area code, the 'Name' should be the area name and then if required and there is additional data in the KML file, further 'data' fields can be added. These columns will appear below and to the right of the map. If not, data can be added later on next to the codes and names.\nIn the add-in version of the tool the final control, 'Scale (% window)' should not normally be changed.  With the default value 0.5, the height of the map is set to be half the total size of the user's Excel window.\nTo run a choropleth, select the menu option 'Run Choropleth' to get this form.\nTo specify the colour ramp for the choropleth, the user needs to enter the number of boxes into which the range is to be divided, and the colours for the high and low ends of the range, which is done by selecting coloured option boxes as appropriate.  If wished, hit the 'Swap' button to change which colours are for the different ends of the range. Then hit the 'Choropleth' button.\nThe default options for the colours of the ends of the choropleth colour range are saved in the add in, but different values can be selected but setting up a column range of up to twelve cells, anywhere in Excel, filled with the option colours wanted.  Then use the 'Colour range' control to select this range, and hit apply, having selected high or low values as wished.  The button 'Copy' sets up a sheet 'ColourRamp' in the active workbook with the default colours, which can just be extended or deleted with just a few cells, so saving the user time.\nThe add-in was developed entirely within the Excel VBA IDE by Tim Lund. He is kindly distributing the tool for free on the Datastore but suggests that users who find the tool useful make a donation to the Shelter charity. It is not intended to keep the actively maintained, but if any users or developers would like to add more features, email the author. \nAcknowledgments\nCalculation of Excel freeform shapes from latitudes and longitudes is done using calculations from the Ordnance Survey. .

Summary: •GLA Economics has produced long-run projections of London’s employment since 2002. These projections are trend based and set out the long run path of employment considered most likely based on the historic data available at the time of construction. These are used within the GLA for planning to provide capacity to accommodate the longer-terms needs of the London economy. Given their importance to GLA policy planning, this note looks at how the GLA Economics’ employment projections have performed since 2002 and how this compares to projections from some other respected organisations.\n•Although GLA Economics’ employment projections are consistently below outturn, much of this is the result of upward revisions to historic employment data (which underpin the projections model). Further, the projections perform relatively well when looking at the projected annual growth rate and average annual error in relation to outturn, with the accuracy of the projections generally improving the longer the time period over which the estimates are analysed.\n•The revisions to historic employment data also drive much of the variability in the GLA Economics’ employment projections numbers over time. However, and by design, the revised projections are relatively consistent over time and average revisions between iterations in GLA Economics employment projections are relatively small..

Summary: The data used in the MPS Custody (Arrests, Disposals, Strip Searches) dashboard is available here Custody Dashboard | Tableau Public, along with the related data definitions. Please note that, this data set runs a month behind with monthly updates.\n\n Arrests \n\nDate criteria is based on Date of Arrest as first recorded on the Custody Record.\nA Custody Record is created when a person reaches a Custody Suite. Data contained only relates to Custody Records created in the Metropolitan Police Service Custody Suites.\nThe volumes show a Count of Custody Records and not a count of individual people. A person may have been arrested/ detained more than once in the periods being viewed.\nThe Officer Defined Ethnicity is recorded on the Custody Record and then grouped as shown for reporting purposes. At the request of the Mayors’ Office for Policing and Crime (MOPAC), the Detainee’s Self Defined Ethnicity is not used in this report.\nChild is defined as a detainee who is at least 10 years of age at the time of Arrest, and under the age of 18 at the time of Arrest.\nThe “First Arrest Offence” is the first reason for arrest given to the Custody Staff by the Arresting Officer and is usually the most serious matter. These have been grouped into broad terms for the purpose of reporting. It must be understood that the Detainee may be dealt with for more than once offence whist in Detention.\nThe demographic breakdown for the Custody Population may not be directly comparable to that of London. The arrested person may be from anywhere in the UK or abroad.\nAlso, due to Central Cell Allocation, even on a local level, a person arrested may not go to a Custody Suite local to the area they live or the area in which they were arrested.\n \n\n Disposal \n\nDate criteria is based on Date of Arrest as first recorded on the Custody Record.\nThe volumes shown are based on a Count of Offences recorded on Custody Records.\nEach Custody Record may have more than one offence recorded on it.\nEach Offence is subject to its own Disposal.\nEach Offence may be given different Disposals at different times. The current (latest) disposal is shown. This may not be the last/ final Disposal.\nA Custody Record may have more than one similar offence recorded on it. Therefore, one Custody Record may have multiple similar offences each with its own/ different disposal.\nDisposal Decisions are based on numerous factors. These may include (but not limited to)\n-        Available evidence\n-        Any admissions\n-        Previous offending history\n-        Willingness of victims/ witnesses to substantiate allegations, make statements etc.\n-        Public arrest criteria\n \n\n Strip Search \n\nDate criteria is based on Date of Arrest as first recorded on the Custody Record.\nThe volumes shown are based on whether Strip Search was recorded as being undertaken at any point during the Detainee’s Detention.\nThe primary reason for a Strip Search being authorised/ conducted in a Custody Suite is to ensure the safety of the Detainee and the people around them. Factors effecting this consideration may be in relation to (but not limited to):\n-        The nature of the offence(s) arrested for (hidden weapons or drugs)\n-        Warning markers on the PNC (Police National Computer)\n-        Concerns raised by responses to Risk Assessment questions.\nStrip Search can be undertaken for any offence, but when looking at specific offences, is more likely to be authorised/ conducted for offences relating to drugs or weapons.\nDetainees can be arrested for more than once offence.\nThe number of Detainee’s Strip Searched can be viewed by the following Offence Groups (and where a detainee has been arrested for one or more offences):\n-        Drug offences\n-        Drugs and other offences\n-        Drugs, Weapons and other offences\n-        Other offences\n-        Weapons and other offences\nThe warning Markers on PNC may refer to the individual secreting items on previous occasions or has indications of self-harm/ attempted suicide. It goes without saying that such warning markers have significant impact on decision making with regard to authorising a strip search.\nAny relevant warning markers on PNC are not recorded on the MPS Custody System in a way that allows data analysis. Therefore, one of the main factors in effecting the reasons for a strip search in not available and any conclusion drawn from the information displayed must take this into account.\nWhen reviewing the demographic data in this dashboard it should first be remembered that this relates to the metropolitan custody detainee populations and not to any wider group.\nWhen viewing the entire Custody Population there is initially a disproportionality in the percentages strip searched. However, when various offence groups are examined it will be seen that there is a significant disproportionality in the breakdown of arrests. Also, given that the details of any PNC warning markers are not available, then it follows that any proportionality issues may not be as unambiguous as may first appear. \n\n\n\n\nDue to an internal IT deployment, from 27th February these datasets may be temporarily disrupted. Work is ongoing to rebuild these datasets.\n. Published by . Tags: Custody, Arrests, Disposals, Custody Strip Seach. Temporal Coverage: None - None. Geospatial Coverage: ."

Summary: \nThis dataset will no longer be updated.\n\nCycle flows on the Transport for London Road Network (TLRN).\nThe purpose of this indicator is to assess the level of cycle use on the TLRN. The overall ambition is to increase cycling levels by 400% such that by 2025 cycling will equate to a 5% mode share of all journey trips.\nThis indicator does not represent cycling across London as a whole, It only represents cycling on the 5% of London’s roads that are the TLRN.\nThe indicator is presented as an indexed flow relative to a baseline of March 2000 (a flow level that is represented as 100 on the index).\nDefinition: Sixty automatic cycle counters on the TLRN provide sample counts of cyclists using the network. The indicator converts these counts into an index that is used to represent increases in cycle flows on the TLRN over time. It does not represent the total number of cyclists in London. Automatic cycling counters are pieces of monitoring equipment that emit a magnetic field that detects the presence of a moving cycle.\nCycling data is collected monthly using telemetry. This is the process whereby live data is wired down a communication line. The data is sent directly to a database. A summary of the data is then forwarded to the Head of the Performance Monitoring Team each period via e-mail.\nWith the future growth of cycling expected to take place not only on the TLRN, but on all the capital’s roads, TfL has developed a new methodology for recording cycling journeys that will run in parallel with the existing cycling index. At the current phase of development, monitoring using this metric is restricted to the central London congestion. Based on this metric, a daily average of 402,199 kilometres – or 131,000 cycle journeys - were cycled during the first Quarter of 2014.\nThe Mayor published his Vision for Cycling in March 2013, outlining plans to spend £913m on cycling improvements over the next 10 years, with a gross budget of £107m in 2014/15..

        "embedding_text": "Title: Cycling Infrastructure Database. Summary: London’s Cycling Infrastructure Database (CID) is the world’s largest and most comprehensive database of cycling infrastructure, containing comprehensive details of cycling infrastructure in the Capital. The CID is intended to address barriers to cycling by providing Londoners with clear and accurate information about cycling infrastructure, helping them plan cycle journeys with confidence. The CID is a core part of our  Cycling Action Plan , which sets out how TfL, boroughs and others will work together to make London the world’s best big city for cycling.\nTo create the database, TfL have surveyed every street in every London borough to collect information on over 240,000 pieces of infrastructure, covering an area of 1,595 square kilometres.\nThe database also contains 480,000 photographs of cycling infrastructure, allowing users to see exactly what can be found on street. For example, cycle parking users will be able to see what type of parking is available. TfL collected data of 146,000 cycle parking spaces across London, as well as gathering information on 2,000km of cycle routes and 58,000 wayfinding signs.\nAn update to TfL's own Journey Planner means that people using the planner for cycle journeys can now see the nearest and most convenient place to park for every journey. Third party developers will be able to use the data for their own journey planning tools, which will make it simpler for Londoners to plan cycle journeys using their preferred apps. We’re excited to see how developers can use the data to help make cycling in the Capital easier, and to kick-start this we will invite app developers to a hackathon this autumn to see how this data can be maximised to benefit people cycling.\nAs well as making it easier for Londoners to plan cycle journeys, the database will help TfL and boroughs to plan future cycling investment. For example, the database has already been used to develop TfL's Cycle Parking Implementation Plan, which sets out how TfL will work with partners across the capital to deliver 50,000 cycle parking spaces over the next six years where they are needed most, to meet the growing demand for safe places to park cycles.\nThe following types of asset are included in the database:\n\nCycle lanes and tracks – including whether they are segregated or painted lanes\nCycle parking, including the type and capacity of parking\nSignalised crossings for cycles\nRestricted route - Modal filters and traffic gates which allow cycles to pass but restrict car traffic\nTraffic calming, including the location of all speed humps in Greater London\nAdvanced stop lines – boxes at junctions for people cycling\nSignals - early-release signals at junctions\nSignage - Signed cycle routes and other wayfinding\nRestricted Points – points where people cycling will have to dismount Paths through parks and other green spaces that can, and cannot, be cycled on\n.

Summary: Areal rainfall is calculated at a daily timestep for 5 areal units which cover London using the Soil Moisture Model developed and run by the Environment Agency.\nFor each areal unit, the areal rainfall and soil moisture deficits (SMDs) are calculated.\n\n\nAreal rainfall – This is calculated using rainfall data collected at one or more rain gauges situated within each areal unit. This is then averaged and weighted across each areal unit.\n\nSoil moisture deficits (SMDs) are calculated using the areal rainfall data and the potential evaporation (PE) estimated for each unit.Realistically, the SMD would vary slightly during the day given showers/thunderstorms etc and the PE would also vary with the time of day and temperature.This sort of detail is not available and unnecessary for most water resources studies, so the SMD is referred to as the day end value.\n\nAll areal rainfall and SMD data provided by the Environment Agency use the best available data at the time of running the soil moisture model and is subject to periodic updates and verification.\nFor SMD, best practice is to refer to end-of-month values and compare with long term average end-of-month values (1961-90)..

Summary: Number of Domestic Energy Performance Certificates (EPC) lodged on the Register, in each Local Authority, by Energy Efficiency Rating (fuel cost) or Environmental Impact Rating (Carbon Dioxide emissions), in each Year/Quarter. Floor area data is broken down by property type. Type of property is broken down into Bungalow, House, Flat, or Maisonette.\nThese tables show data from certificates lodged on the Energy Performance of Buildings (EPB) Registers since 2008, including average energy efficiency ratings, energy use, carbon dioxide emissions, fuel costs, average floor area sizes and numbers of certificates recorded.\nData lodged on the EPB Registers record information about the certificates issued for buildings which have been newly constructed, sold or let since 2008. Data lodged on the EPB Registers will also include buildings for which multiple EPCs have been issued.\nOn 1 April 2012, the first set of Scheme Operating Requirements came into effect for Domestic Energy Assessors, which set new rules for the operation of Accreditation Schemes. One new requirement was to introduce quality assurance audit of EPCs. The result was a demonstrable improvement in the quality of data lodged on the EPB Registers from mid-2012 onwards. Users are asked to consider this when interpreting figures prior to that period. In May 2009, additional validation checks were introduced into the register lodgement process to identify prescribed data quality issues. Before this period, statistics for domestic buildings may include anomalies to CO2 emission rates. In addition, statistics for domestic and non-domestic buildings and for DECs may include anomalies which affect total floor area figures.\nView some of the floor area data as cartograms (maps) for London here.\nMore information can be found on the DCLG website.\n\n\n\n\nThis dataset is one of the Greater London Authority's measures of Economic Fairness.

Summary: The Mayor of London committed to developing a London Wellbeing and Sustainability Measure in his 2021 manifesto. This was to help measure London’s success as a place to live and work for all its residents. It would counteract the fact that, for years, London’s success has been mostly measured only in terms of its material wealth. \nGLA City Intelligence led the development of this measure of wellbeing and sustainability. It brings together data on the multiple aspects of our lives that form the basis of our collective wellbeing. This enables us to track which aspects of our lives are getting better over time and focus on the areas that need improvement.\nThe London Wellbeing and Sustainability Framework was developed through a review of frameworks used by other cities, liaising with likely users of the measure to understand how it could inform their work, and by conducting in-depth qualitative research with a range of Londoners to ensure it reflects the things that matter to people.\nFrom this, City Intelligence produced a draft framework, a qualitative research report based on research with Londoners between December 2021 and January 2022, and a community engagement report based on roundtables with community groups in January 2022.\nFollowing this, in August 2022, City Intelligence produced a draft proposal for a measure, which included a document setting out the work undertaken so far and how this had led to the proposals, and a document providing further supporting detail on the recommended data for the measure.\nIn January 2023, City Intelligence held a key stakeholder consultation involving boroughs and London organisations to refine its proposal and finalise the draft framework.\nYou can download detailed reports below on this participatory research process we underwent with Londoners.\nIn October 2023, City Intelligence officially launched the \nLondon Wellbeing and Sustainability Measure\n. This followed an intensive period of data collation of a wide array of London's data on wellbeing, which we have made available via the \nData Explorer tool\n.\nIf you have any questions regarding the London Wellbeing and Sustainability Measure, please get in touch by sending an email to socialevidence@london.gov.uk..

Summary: This is a summary report on the economic impact of COVID-19 on London’s small and medium enterprises (SMEs). It presents a uniquely granular and timely analysis of the impacts on London’s SMEs by sectoral, financial, employment, and risk indicators and includes deep dive case studies on the economic impact on the Night Time Economy, high streets and town centres, and the Culture and Creative industries.\nThe analysis was undertaken on a pro bono basis by Bloomberg Associates, for and in close collaboration with the GLA providing guidance and direction. Partners supporting Bloomberg Associates included Slalom, Burning Glass Technologies, DueDil and CK Delta. It leverages a combination of public and private data from a range of financial, economic, behavioural, sociographic and demographic sources and complements the macro-economic scenarios for the London economy.\nThe study was conducted between March 2020 and June 2020 and leverages the most updated data that was available at the time. It is important to note that new data and evidence constantly emerges and could be integrated in a potential future iteration of this work. The report has sought to:\n\nIllustrate the impact of the pandemic on London’s SMEs and local employment and improve understanding of the scale and scope of the economic challenges that London faces in recovery.\nDemonstrate the application of “bottom-up” and localised data to create a more complete, granular picture of overall economic impact\nShow the intersection of impact by sectors and geographies, exploring the relationship between these two factors to demonstrate the risk hot spots across Greater London.\n\nIf you have any comments or questions related to the report, please email GLA Economics\n.

Summary: The EPR is an annual rating which generates a rating from zero to four stars for grant holders based upon a provider’s performance in three Key Performance Areas (KPAs): delivery performance, quality and contract compliance. For each KPA, performance is assessed through one or more performance indicators. The weighting each indicator contributes towards a KPA score has been developed in consultation with providers and the Performance Ratings should place a high emphasis on performance (i.e. outputs and results).\n\nKey Performance Area (KPA) Weighting Indicators (KPI) Weighting of indicator within KPA Contract Performance 60% 1. Delivery against grant targets 48% 2. Delivery against grant diversity targets 12% Quality 30% 3. Conversion Factor 12% 4. Self assessment of quality 9% 5. Client Satisfaction 9% Contract Compliance 10% 6. Contract compliance and contractor pro-activity in delivery 10%\nThe idea behind the ratings is to identify good performance and also highlight where projects may need to improve to deliver better results. The ratings also allows the funding bodies to identify the top performing organisations more easily and make more informed funding decisions.\n“The Employability Performance Rating tool is a great way of both demonstrating and measuring the value of European Social Fund funded programmes in London, and we are delighted that London’s ESF co-financing organisations have adopted it.” Alex Conway, London European Programmes Director.\n\nThe 2017/18 ratings are now published. Please see the below document to view the different ratings providers have received. The briefing for the 2017/18 ratings is also available to download. Last year's ratings are still available to download below.\nFull Employability Performance Rating details can be found in the charts and tables below:\nIn chart form, this will be available for this year's ratings soon - http://data.london.gov.uk/employability-performance-rating-charts/\n\n \nOr in an excel spreadsheet below:.

However, if mortality starts to increase prior to this, for example in November, the number of deaths in the non-winter period will increase, which in turn will decrease the estimate of excess winter mortality.\n\nThe EWM Index will be partly dependent on the proportion of older people in the population as most excess winter deaths effect older people (there is no standardisation in this calculation by age or any other factor).\n\nExcess winter mortality is calculated as winter deaths (deaths occurring in December to March) minus the average of non-winter deaths (April to July of the current year and August to November of the previous year).

The recent Marmot Review of health inequalities noted that “What a child experiences during the early years lays down the foundation for the whole of their life.” The Mayor’s Health Inequality Strategy for London responds to this by challenging all partners in London to create “conditions that lead to better early years experiences”.\n\nThis chapter, authored by colleagues at the London Health Observatory, provides recent evidence on the health experience of children and young people in London. The report includes data about the Local Index of Child Wellbeing, infant mortality, breastfeeding, immunisation, injury, childhood obesity, physical activity, diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, drug use, teenage conceptions and sexual health.

The pressures of housing demand in London have grown in recent years, in part due to fewer people leaving London to buy homes in other regions. But while new supply during the recession held up better in London than in other regions, it needs to increase significantly in order to meet housing needs and reduce housing costs to more affordable levels.\n\nThis edition of Focus on London authored by James Gleeson in the Housing Unit looks at housing trends in London, from the demand/supply imbalance to the consequences for affordability and housing need.\n\nREPORT:\n\nRead the report in PDF format.\n\n\n\nPRESENTATION:\n\nHow much pressure is London’s popularity putting on housing provision in the capital?

Summary: FOCUSONLONDON2010:INCOMEANDSPENDINGATHOME\n\nHousehold income in London far exceeds that of any other region in the UK. At £900 per week, London’s gross weekly household income is 15 per cent higher than the next highest region. Despite this, the costs to each household are also higher in the capital. Londoners pay a greater amount of their income in tax and national insurance than the UK average as well as footing a higher bill for housing and everyday necessities. All of which leaves London households less well off than the headline figures suggest.\n\nThis chapter, authored by Richard Walker in the GLA Intelligence Unit, begins with an analysis of income at both individual and household level, before discussing the distribution and sources of income.

Summary: Age-standardised proportion of adults (16+) who met the recommended guidelines of consuming five or more portions of fruit and vegetables a day by gender.\nTo help reduce the risk of deaths from chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, and cancer. The Five-a-day programme was introduced to increase fruit and vegetable consumption within the general population. Its central message is that people should eat at least five portions of fruit and vegetables a day; that a variety of fruit and vegetables should be consumed and that fresh, frozen, canned and dried fruit, vegetables and pulses all count in making up these portions. The programme includes educational initiatives to increase awareness of the Five-a-day message and the benefits of fruit and vegetable consumption, along with more direct schemes to increase access to fruit and vegetables, such as the school fruit scheme and community initiatives. Monitoring of fruit and vegetable consumption is key to evaluating the success of the policy, both at the level of individual schemes and at a more general level.\nThe England average, at the 95% confidence level (LCL = lower confidence interval; UCL = upper confidence interval).\nRelated to: National Indicator Library - NHS England Digital (editor note: was https://indicators.ic.nhs.uk/webview/)\n\n\n.

Summary: \nIntroduction\n\nThe GiGL Open Space Friends Group subset provides locations and boundaries for selected open space sites in Greater London.\nThe chosen sites represent sites that have established Friends Groups in Greater London and are therefore important to local communities, even if they may not be accessible open spaces, or don’t typically function as destinations for leisure, activities and community engagement*.\nFriends Groups are groups of interested local people who come together to protect, enhance and improve their local open space or spaces.\nThe dataset has been created by Greenspace Information for Greater London CIC (GiGL). As London’s Environmental Records Centre, GiGL mobilises, curates and shares data that underpin our knowledge of London’s natural environment. We provide impartial evidence to support informed discussion and decision making in policy and practice.\nGiGL maps under licence from the Greater London Authority. \n*Publicly accessible sites for leisure, activities and community engagement can be found in GiGL's Spaces to Visit dataset\n\nDescription\n\n\nThis dataset is a sub-set of the  GiGL Open Space dataset, the most comprehensive dataset available of open spaces in London. Sites are selected for inclusion in the Friends Group subset based on whether there is a friends group recorded for the site in the Open Space dataset.\nThe dataset is a mapped Geographic Information System (GIS) polygon dataset where one polygon (or multi-polygon) represents one space. As well as site boundaries, the dataset includes information about a site’s name, size, access and type (e.g. park, playing field etc.) and the name and/or web address of the site’s friends group.\nGiGL developed the dataset to support anyone who is interested in identifying sites in London with friends groups - including friends groups and other community groups, web and app developers, policy makers and researchers - with an open licence data source. More detailed and extensive data are available under GiGL data use licences for GIGL partners, researchers and students. Information services are also available for ecological consultants, biological recorders, community groups and members of the public – please see www.gigl.org.uk for more information.\nThe dataset is updated on a quarterly basis. If you have questions about this dataset please contact GiGL’s GIS and Data Officer.\n\nData sources\n\n\nThe boundaries and information in this dataset are a combination of data collected during the London Survey Method habitat and open space survey programme (1986 – 2008) and information provided to GiGL from other sources since. These sources include London borough surveys, land use datasets, volunteer surveys, feedback from the public, park friends’ groups, and updates made as part of GiGL’s on-going data validation and verification process. \n\n\nThis is a preliminary version of the dataset as there is currently low coverage of friends groups in GiGL’s Open Space database. We are continually working on updating and improving this dataset. If you have any additional information or corrections for sites included in GiGL’s Friends Group subset please contact  GiGL’s GIS and Data Officer.\nNOTE: The dataset contains OS data © Crown copyright and database rights 2024.

Summary: Notes and slides from the Conference at City Hall on 30 September 2019 examining the role of new approaches, methods and tools in helping shape public policy and the delivery of public services on the ground. . \nSeen in the round, rather than as discrete innovations, these amount to a growing revolution in our approach to public service design and delivery. The combined use of machine learning, the Internet of Things, user-centred design, mapping applications, tools that engage citizens, dynamic simulation - and much more besides – has been growing in recent years: now, they are moving centre stage. \nThis conference showcased actual applications recently developed in London and elsewhere, how and why they were created, and consider how they might evolve, given the array of challenges facing the city, from cybersecurity to Brexit.

Summary: From 1 August 2019, the Secretary of State for Education delegated responsibility for the commissioning, delivery, and management of London’s Adult Education Budget (AEB) to the Mayor of London.\nIn early 2020, the AEB Mayoral Board agreed that AEB programme data should be published following the Department for Education’s Further Education and Skills data publication and in line with the UK Code of Practice for Official Statistics (which the Greater London Authority has signed up to on a voluntary basis). \nThis GLA AEB data publication provides information on adult (aged 19+) GLA-funded Further Education, comprising Education and training and Community learning (excluding apprenticeships, traineeships, advanced learner loans, the offender learning and skills service, and education and training services funded by the Education and Skills Funding Agency). \nThe accompanying note assists in interpreting the statistics and highlights some key points and data limitations.\nThe accompanying technical document provides information on the data sources, their coverage and quality and explains the methodology used in producing the data.\nWherever in-year data is used, it presents provisional, reported to date figures. These are updated in subsequent data returns, and should not be considered the final record of provision in that time period.\nThe data in this release should be treated as Experimental Statistics as the methodologies used to produce them are still in their developmental phase..

Summary: The percentage of the economically active population who are claiming Job Seekers Allowance (JSA).\nOutput from the GLA claimant count model which uses administrative counts of Job Seekers and expresses them as a percentage of the labour force using GLA projections of the economically active population. Designed to complement ONS claimant count rates which use the whole population as the denominator.\nFrom October 2015, the series included here is JSA CLAIMANTS ONLY. Output from the GLA ward level Claimant Count Model for 2015. There have been changes to the data published to create these rates. From May 2015, the official claimant count data changed at national and regional levels to include all claimants of Universal Credit not in employment (including those not subject to work related criteria).However, comparable data were not available by age and duration and the small area data did not include these claimants. From October 2015, this group of Universal Credit claimants were included in the small area data, but no duration data is available. However, the data in the files posted here (as released by ONS) were for the published claimant count up to September 2015 and from October 2015 continue to include JSA only.\nAt December 2015 there were more than 10,000 Universal Credit claimants in London, of whom 3,400 (34 per cent) were in employment. The borough with the largest number of these is Tower Hamlets with over 900 UC claimants not in employment, Some other boroughs had quite large numbers, but in 13 boroughs there were 10 or fewer recorded UC claimants not in employment. From January 2016 data this series will be replaced with a new series that uses the claimant count data that are available. Other breaks in the series are expected over 2016-17.\nNew Claimant Count Model Output\n2015 model (xls) 2014 model (xls) 2013 model (xls) 2012 model (xls) 2011 model (xls)\nOther Resources\nClaimant Count Time Series - Ward claimant count summary data for the period 2011-2014\nUpdate - New claimant count model methodology\nInstant Atlas - An interactive visualisation of the GLA ward claimant count model 2015 model (IA) 2014 model (IA) 2013 model (IA) 2012 model (IA) 2011 model (IA)\nHistorical Models - Ward claimant count models 2010-2014 (old methodology).

Green indicates that performance is meeting or exceeding targets; amber that it is somewhat short of target; and red that is significantly short.\nThe second traffic light is forward looking and is primarily concerned with whether future targets, and in particular the lifetime target, are likely to be met. Green here indicates that performance is on track and amber that there are risks that may mean future targets will be missed.

        "embedding_text": "Title: GLA population projection service. Summary: The GLA Demography Team offers a bespoke population projection service to London local authorities. Boroughs can request population projections based on their own choice of assumptions about future housing delivery. These assumptions are submitted to the team via a standard template. The resulting projections are referred to as the Borough Preferred Option (or BPO) and are commonly used to help support local planning and service delivery.\nThe GLA does not make the BPO projections and submitted housing trajectories publicly available or share them with anyone other than the commissioning borough. Boroughs wishing to publish BPO projections themselves are free to do so.\nThis service is offered as an optional, free of charge service to London authorities, and is intended to provide users with an alternative to the standard projections that the GLA publishes on the London Datastore. \n\nAccess to outputs\n\nThe BPO projections are shared with users via private pages on the London Datastore. These pages include all outputs produced under the service since 2019.\nTo access outputs, users must have a current Datastore account linked to their local government email address and contact the Demography Team to request permissions be granted for the individual pages relating to their local authority.\n\nNotes on completing the development data template\n\n\nWhat periods do the year labels in the template refer to?\n\nThe year labels in the template nominally refer to periods ending in the middle of that year (i.e. `2025` refers to the 12 month period ending June 30th 2025). However, development data is often readily available only for financial years and it is common to submit data on this basis, with financial year 2024/25 aligning with `2025` in the template.\n\nDevelopment trajectory\n\nThe cells in the template represent annual net changes in the number of dwellings.\nThe current template covers the period 2012-2041 and are pre-populated with estimated annual net dwelling changes for the period 2012-2019, based on modelling of data from the London Development Database.\nFor the 2022-based and subsequent projections, dwelling stock estimates are anchored to the results of the 2021 Census and it is not essential to include data for dwelling stock changes that occured prior to this point (i.e. up to and including '2021').\nPast development data from 2022 up to the base year of the projections, affects the projected population in all future years as dwelling stock in the base year is used in the estimation of relationships between housing and population in the model.\nWe are not yet able to pre-populate templates with estimated dwelling changes for years after 2019. In future rounds of projections we intend to incorporate data from the Planning Data Hub. \nBlank cells are treated as missing rather than no change, and data based on the 2017 Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA) will be substituted in its place. To indicate no net change in dwellings in a ward in a particular year, users must explicitly enter a zero in the relevant cell.\n\nSelf-contained and Non-self-contained development\n\nSelf-contained development should be used for standard residential development (e.g. new build/conversion).\nNon-self-contained development should be used for development such as student accommodation. This should be added to the template as the equivalent of self-contained units (i.e. a ratio of non-self-contained to self-contained should be applied). The London Plan ratios are:\n·       2.5:1 for student housing\n·       1:1 for housing for older people (C2)\n·       1.8:1 for all other non-self-contained housing\n\nRequesting projections based on multiple different housing scenarios\n\nWhile we are willing to try and accommodate requests for multiple sets of projections, capacity in the team is limited and there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so in a timely manner.\n\nPlease do not\n\n\nAdd rows or columns to the template\nChange ward names or codes\nInclude formulas or new formatting\nAdd notes or comments to the template\nReturn data in a different version of the template to those included here\n\nPlease return completed templates to:\n\ndemography@london.gov.uk\n.

Summary: Templates for the submission of data for use in the GLA School Roll Projection Service\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes on completing the Actual Roll templates:\n\nSubscribers should use the templates included on this page to provide roll data for individual schools. This data should be split by national curriculum year and gender. Data for primary and secondary schools should be provided in the separate templates. Data for special schools and pupil referral units should be excluded.\nPlease do not change the names of position of the column headers or change the file format of the template.\nPlanning Area: This is used for aggregation of projections into planning area level projections. Where possible, it is recommended that the same naming convention for planning areas is used each year to faciliatate the comparison of results between successive rounds of projections. If a school is not in a planning area then this field should be left blank.\nDfE Number: Please enter the school’s DfE number either with or without the borough identifier.\nSchool Name: Where a school has both a primary and secondary phase the school name should be consistent across both roll files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes on completing the Ward to Planning Area Matrix:\n\nThese matrices are used to apportion ward-level population data to education planning areas. Estimated and projected population by education planning area are produced as reporting outputs, and serve to provide context to and assist with quality assurance of the roll projections themselves.\nIt is only necessary to provide a new matrix in the event of changes to existing planning areas.\nThe matrices are not used directly in the production of the scholl roll projections, which are instead based on relationships between pupil's ward of residence and school attended that have been derived from anonymised extracts of records from the National Pupil Database.\nThe templates are pre-populated with default identifiers for planning areas (PA1 to PA15). If necessary, these should be changed to be consistent with the planning area names used in the submitted Actual Roll templates.\nEach cell in the body of the matrix represents the proportion of the population for the ward in the cell's row that should be allocated to the planning area in the cell's column. This proportion should be a value between 0 and 1, with blank cells being treated as zeroes.\nBoth primary and (if applicable) secondary school planning areas should be included in the same template. If only primary planning areas are included, the values of the cells in each row should sum to 1. If secondary planning areas are also included, they should sum to 2.\nThere is no single \"correct\" way to assign ward populations to planning areas in the template - different local authorities draw up planning area boundaries using different methods and criteria, and the method used to apportion the population here is inherrently crude. In practice, rough approximations are sufficient for the purpose to which they are applied.. Published by GLA Demography. Tags: No tags. Temporal Coverage: None - None. Geospatial Coverage: ."

In particular, the SMF undertook a literature review of academic, government and policy papers on degree outcomes and the factors that interact with these; conducted descriptive analysis of data provided by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA); and ran a series of logit regression models to look further into how different characteristics influence graduate outcomes when controlling for other variables.

The approach makes use of the fact that vegetation reflects infrared light and enables the modelling of all of London’s green infrastructure, not just the elements that are accessible for on-the-ground surveying. \nThis page hosts the results of the green cover assessment, while another Datastore page hosts the results of the canopy cover assessment.\nThe green cover modelling is supplemented with the addition of other land use data (in this case, categories from the Ordnance Survey MasterMap Topography Layer) given the technique struggles to pick up bare ground such as farming land or very worn grass. \nMore information is available within the methodology report below and resulting cover estimates (%) are provided here by borough and ward.

Summary: Overview\nAn updated spatial data set for existing green roofs has been produced for London's Central Activities Zone (CAZ) using 2015 aerial imagery. The CAZ makes up around two per cent of London's total area.\nMethod\nArcMap GIS software was used to map green roofs installations. The aerial imagery was loaded into the software in true colour (RGB) and infrared (IR) composites, along with the CAZ boundary and London 500x500m Ordnance Survey grid to aid locating.\n\n\n\nRGB images are useful for both roof types with IR being very good for identifying vegetation. IR allows for easy identification of vegetation due to it reflecting strongly in the near infrared (NIR) and appearing deep red in colour (healthy vegetation).\nChallenges and solutions\nThe problem of judging elevation from aerial imagery, particularly of buildings with only a few stories can be partially overcome by comparing the location with Google Maps Earth view. This includes a digital elevation model that makes it easier to judge whether a green area is raised or at street level. \n\n\n\nA number of small roof terraces in the CAZ have very dense vegetation along the edge of the roof. Where this kind of greening is spatially significant, the vegetation itself has been mapped rather than the full extent of the roof, in order to produce a more appropriate and accurate green area value. \n\n\n\nBuilding shadows can mask the texture and colour of the roof. The use of NIR helps with green roof identification, as the contrast of the red of the vegetation with the surrounding area is far higher than in RGB, making the shadow less impactful.\n\n\n\nSome roofs that appear very uniformly green in RGB may be Astroturf as opposed to a living green roof. This can usually be identified by inspecting the roof in IR, as it will not give the distinctive deep/bright red colours of living vegetation, displaying instead as blue-purple. \n\n\n\nEven analysing a small area of London, such as the CAZ, takes a long time. This is the main reason why this study methodology has not been extended beyond the CAZ.. Published by Katherine Drayson. Tags: Greening, Biodiversity, Sustainable Drainage.

Summary: The draft London Health Inequalities Strategy This document outlines the main issues that lead to inequalities in the health of different groups of Londoners, and a set of aims for reducing them. It outlines the Mayor’s role, but also how other organisations working in health in London can work together to ensure that all Londoners can benefit from a healthy lifestyle.\nThe draft strategy was published on the London.gov.uk website on 23 August 2017 for a 14-week public consultation (closing 30 November 2017).\nThe Report to the Mayor provides a high-level summary and analysis of the issues raised during the consultation of the draft strategy, from both technical stakeholders and members of the public. This allowed the Mayor to have proper regard to the consultation responses when deciding whether to approve the final version of the strategy.\nThe public responded to the consultation via Talk London online discussion threads and surveys; and via representative polling. The Talk London datasets and emailed responses were analysed by policy area, and compared against insights from the representative polling. This allowed the team to identify any similarities or differences between the views of the general population and the views of the Talk London community.\nAll datasets on a policy area were brought together in a single thematic summary report, which aimed to show where the balance of opinion lay, as well as highlight areas of disagreement or debate.

Summary: This house price per square metre dataset is created through complex address-based matching between the Land Registry’s Price Paid Data (LR-PPD) and property size information from the Domestic Energy Performance Certificates (EPC) data published by the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC, formerly MHCLG). Details of the data linkage are published in the UCL Open: Environment along with the related linkage code via the UK Data Service ReShare repository.\nDuring this data linkage process, the transactions assigned as category B (Additional Price Paid entry) and other property types are removed. Here we publish our latest limited attribute version of the uncorrected house price per square metre dataset in England and Wales with the LR-PPD data (1/1/1995-26/2/2021) and Domestic EPCs data (the sixth version, up to 20/9/2020) downloaded on 1/4/2021 for non-commercial purpose. This uncorrected version of house price per square metre dataset records over 18 million transactions with 16 variables in England and Wales since 1995. Unlike in our published article, in this uncorrected version we have not removed transactions with any improbable price per square metre values - i.e. where either the transaction price or total floor area values are null, 0 or too low to be realistic. This uncorrected version of the data will offer the most flexibility for researchers.\nWe offer technical validation and data cleaning code via the UKDA ReShare repository to help users evaluate the representation of the linked data for a given time period. The data cleaning code shows our methods for cleaning up unlikely floor size records before using this data in analysis. Users can create their own rules and undertake this clean-up process based on their own experience and research aims.\nThis limited attribute version is published by local authority (2021 version). Details of the 16 variables are described in the explanation file. The National Statistics Postcode Lookup NSPL (May 2021 version) is used to assign the local authority unit for your production of area-based statistics. Users can match historical changes in LA boundaries by choosing appropriate aggregations using, for instance ONSPD, and the postcode variable in our dataset.\nAn extended version of this dataset containing additional variables is available from UK Data Service Reshare service. Users can directly access this full version dataset (tranall_link_01042021.zip) via the following link:  https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/855033/ . Accompanying LR-PPD and EPC data are also supplied through the ReShare service. Users who would like to attach their own additional variables from the LR-PPD data are advised to use the transactionid variable to link to the LR-PPD (LRPPD_01042021.zip). Users who would like to attach additional variables from the EPC data are advised to use the id variable to link to the sixth version Domestic EPCs (epc6_id.zip). \n\nThe 2024 update\n\n\nThe 2024 updated version of the house price per square metre dataset extends the data coverage to the end of 2024 (\nhpm_la_2024.zip\n). This new version is the result of linking LR-PPD data (01/01/1995–31/10/2024) and Domestic EPCs data (up to 31/10/2024), downloaded on 26/12/2024 for non-commercial purposes. It records over 22 million transactions in England and Wales since 1995.\n\n\nUnlike the previous versions, this updated removes the id variable (created by the authors) and adds the lmk_key variable (originally from the Domestic EPCs dataset). This change was made because the lmk_key serves as a unique identifier with no duplicate records since 2024.\n\n\nThe match rate of the linked data varies over time; therefore, we recommend users carefully choose the time coverage and validate the data coverage using the match rate. Please note that publicly available Domestic EPCs data starts in 2008, resulting in an extremely low match rate for the period between 1995 and 2008.\n\n\nThe National Statistics Postcode Lookup (November 2024 version) is used to assign local authorities (2023 version) for this publication. An extended version of this dataset, containing additional variables from LR-PPD and Domestic EPCs, will be available from the UK Data Service Reshare platform.\n\n\nAlternatively, users can use the lmk_key variable to link additional variables from the Domestic EPCs dataset or use the transactionid to add in other information from the LR-PPD dataset.\n\n\nThe 2023 update\n\n\n In 2023, a third updated version of the house price per square metre dataset has been published on the London Datastore ( hpm_la_2023.zip ). This new version extends the data coverage to 2023, but keeps the same publication format as the first publication. The new version is the linked result based on LR-PPD data (1/1/1995-31/10/2023) and Domestic EPCs data (end with 31/10/2023) downloaded on 2/12/2023 for non-commercial purposes. This uncorrected version of the house price per square metre dataset records almost 21 million transactions in England and Wales since 1995.\nThe match rate of this linked data varies across time, thus we suggest the user chooses the time coverage needed based on their own research. The id variable has been newly generated for this new version of the Domestic EPC dataset published by DLUHC at the end of the 2023, so it is not the same as the id variable in our previous publication( hpm_la.zip   or    hpm_la_2022.zip ) and should not be used to link between the new and the previous publication.\n\n The National Statistics Postcode Lookup NSPL (November 2023 version) is used to assign the local authority unit for this second publication. An extended version of this dataset containing additional variables from LR-PPD and Domestic EPCs will be available in due course from UK Data Service Reshare service.\n\nThe 2022 update\n\nIn 2022, a second updated version of the house price per square metre dataset has been published on the London Datastore (hpm_la_2022.zip). This new version extends the data coverage to 2022, but keeps the same publication format as the first publication. The new version is the linked result based on LR-PPD data (1/1/1995-27/6/2022) and Domestic EPCs data (the twelfth version: end with 30/6/2022) downloaded on 13/8/2022 for non-commercial purposes. This uncorrected version of the house price per square metre dataset records almost 20 million transactions in England and Wales since 1995.\nThe match rate of this linked data before 2008 is lower, thus we suggest the user chooses the time coverage needed based on their own research. The id variable has been newly generated for this new data from the twelfth version of the Domestic EPC dataset published by DLUHC, so it is not the same as the id variable in our previous publication(hpm_la.zip) and should not be used to link between the new and the previous publication.\n\nThe National Statistics Postcode Lookup NSPL (August 2022 version) is used to assign the local authority unit for this second publication. An extended version of this dataset containing additional variables from LR-PPD and Domestic EPCs is available on the UK Data Service (  https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/856204/  )\n.

Summary: Number of households waiting for local authority housing.\nLocal authorities sometimes maintain a common waiting list with the Housing Association/s in their district. However, no information is available where a Housing Association maintains a separate waiting list to the local authority. Direct comparisons between authorities' housing waiting lists can be misleading in particular because authorities have different arrangements for checking that applicants continue to require housing and their policies and practices can change over time.\nThe introduction of choice-based approaches to the letting of social housing (whereby applicants have more of a say and choice over where they live) has had an impact on the size of the waiting list. Choice-based lettings (CBL) has led to increases in the number of households on the waiting lists, including those groups which are traditionally under-represented in social housing, e.g. people in employment. The accuracy of the list also depends on the extent to which housing authorities keep the register up-to-date, e.g. some people might already have found housing, yet remain on the list. The introduction of CBL and the removal of the statutory duty to maintain a register have taken away much of the rationale for regularly reviewing the waiting list.\nHowever, it was anticipated that housing authorities would continue to maintain a waiting list of housing applicants in order to perform their allocation function properly. The districts, unitary authorities and counties listed above are based on 1 April 1998 boundaries. Figures for any \"new\" re-organised areas have been estimated retrospectively applying the new boundaries back to 1996, making appropriate assumptions for any county re-organisation which involved cutting across districts.\nSome earlier years' data might have changed based on updated figures in later years' returns.\nLatest available mid-year household estimates for the districts used.\nData for each year are from the year in which they were reported. For example, 2007/08 data is from HSSA 2007/08 returns.\nView live tables on rents and tenancies on DCLG website. Published by Opinion Research and General Statistics (GLA).

It is paid to people who are assessed as being incapable of work and who meet certain contribution conditions.\nThere are three rates of Incapacity Benefit. There are two short-term rates: the lower rate (IBST(L)) is paid for the first 28 weeks of sickness and the higher rate (IBST(H)) for weeks 29 to 52. The long-term rate (IBLT) applies to people who have been sick for more than a year. The higher short-term rate and the long-term rate are treated as taxable income. For the first 28 weeks of incapacity, people previously in work are assessed on the ‘own occupation’ test, i.e. the claimant’s ability to do their own job. Otherwise incapacity is based on the ‘personal capability assessment’ (formerly ‘all work test’), which assesses ability to carry out a range of work-related activities. The test applies after 28 weeks of incapacity or from the start of the claim for people who did not previously have a job. Certain people are exempt from the personal capability assessment. These include, those in receipt of the Disability Living Allowance care component at the higher rate, those registered blind, and those suffering from a severe illness (for example tetraplegia, persistent vegetative state, dementia).\nIncreases are paid for a dependant who is caring for a child or where the spouse is aged 60 or over. Increases for children are paid with the short-term higher rate and with the long-term rate. With the introduction of the new Child Tax Credit on 6 April 2003 no new child dependency increases were awarded, although all existing increases were transitionally protected. An age addition is paid with the long-term rate.. Published by Opinion Research and General Statistics (GLA). Tags: disability, benefits, borough-economic. Temporal Coverage: None - None.

In outputs figures are rounded to the nearest 10.\nData relate to a single point in time, the reference date, and provide a snapshot of claims at that point. The reference date is the last day of the month in question. Data are not seasonally adjusted so any comparisons should be made year on year.\nExercise caution when using time series as figures are affected by the introduction of the Child Tax Credit (CTC) in April 2003. After August 2003 there was a sharp decline in the total number of claimants. This is due to the migration of most existing Minimum Income Guarantee claimants (1.8 million) to Pension Credit, which was introduced in October 2003.\nFigures under 500 are subject to high sampling variation and should be used with caution. - These figures are missing.\nDownload from NOMISweb https://www.nomisweb.co.uk.

It tracks the prices paid for renting property from private landlords in Great Britain.\nIPHRP is produced from a number of administrative sources and is classified as experimental by ONS.\nThe index compares trends (rather than levels) in average private sector rents across English regions, Wales and Scotland. It uses a complex mix-adjustment and weighting process to produce a single index for each area. This index uses data on actual new and ongoing rents.\nThe sample ensures that the index is representative of the stock at regional level and that it isn't distorted by units dropping out of the sample because they switch to LHA or for other reasons. This is an advantage over the VOA dataset where the sample is changing over time and may not be representative.\nTables show monthly data.

Summary: This report and dataset were commissioned by the Greater London Authority, and produced by Centric Lab to uncover the work of community groups that connect with environmental issues in Hackney, Newham, Tower Hamlets and Waltham Forest.\nThese four boroughs were selected as they have some of the highest representation of multi-ethnic low income communities who were greatly affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Many reports highlighted the role of environmental pollutants and structural deprivation as a determinant of Covid-19 infection and impact.\nAs evidenced in this report communities demonstrate numerous and diverse capabilities in tackling the structural challenges of modern day London. This report highlights the different community groups committed to improving the lives of their families, neighbours, and future generations who grace the place they call home. The Mayor of London’s Engaging Londoners in Recovery Programme 2021-2023 sets out an agenda to champion this intellect and capacity to help deliver bottom-up led change in policy such as that of a Green New Deal for London.\nThis report was produced in late 2021 and early 2022 when ‘Plan B’ Covid-19 restrictions were in place for most of its duration. This project was a desktop study and focused on working remotely. All data was gathered through online means and digital communications. This means that despite collating the amazing work of 143 organisations there’s a chance some were missed due to low digital visibility. . Published by Melissa Bennett. Tags: No tags.

Summary: This dataset estimate the number and percentage of jobs held by EEA born workers earning less than £30,000 per year in 2017 by industry in London.\n\n\n\n\nThe total number of jobs in London broken down by industry section (SIC2007), and the percentage held by those born in the European Economic Area (EEA), from the Annual Population Survey (APS) 2017. The data this is based on can be found here.\nThe percentage of employee jobs paying less than £30,000 per year broken down by industry section (SIC2007) for London from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) 2017 (provisional). The data this is based on can be found here.\nIndicative estimates of the total number and percentage of jobs which are held by EEA born workers and paying below £30,000 per year based on GLA Economics calculations.\n\n\n\n\nThe GLA Economics estimated percentages of EEA workers earning less than £30,000 per year by industry group have been calculated by applying the share of jobs held by EEA workers in each industry (from APS) to the percentage of employee jobs paying less than £30,000 per year (from ASHE). The numbers are calculated by applying this to estimates of total jobs in each industry (APS).\n\n\n\n\nPlease be aware: these estimates have been produced with restrictions on data availability and are based on a number of simplifying assumptions. As such, these should only be regarded as rough estimates of the number and share of jobs in London which are held by workers born in the EEA and are likely to be paying below £30,000 per year. The estimates should, therefore, be used with caution.\n\n\n\nFor example, the methodology implicitly assumes that the percentage of employee jobs paid below £30,000 is the same for employee and self-employed jobs and for EEA and non-EEA workers, as well as for jobs held for less than one year.

Summary: These slides begin to explore the potential impacts of the transition to a net-zero carbon and circular economy on different industry groups and workers in London.\nIt should be noted that this analysis has not been based on London’s emissions as reported through the London Energy and Greenhouse Gas Inventory (LEGGI). Instead we use UK level data on emissions and energy consumption by industry group and apportion to a London level using regional employment estimates.\nThis is an imperfect approach, intended to provide a first approximation of trends by industry group based on available data. The findings provide an initial insight but should be treated with caution.\n\n\nMain findings from the analysis\n\nAmong the main findings, the analysis shows that by industry group:\n\nLondon apportioned GHG emissions are highest in Transport & Storage, followed by Electricity & Gas and Manufacturing\nHigh-emitting industry groups tend to account for a relatively small share of employment among London residents\nSome (but not all) high-emitting industry groups have seen a recent increase in GHG emissions at the UK level and employment at the London level\nJobs in high-emitting industry groups tend to be spatially concentrated in different parts of London\n\n\n  What are the main assumptions behind these findings?\n\n\nIn the absence of sub-national estimates being available by industry group, we have apportioned UK GHG emissions and energy consumption to London using (resident based) ONS Annual Population Survey data. This allows us to look at trends using Standard Industrial Classification (SIC 2007) groups.\n\n\nThis approach assumes that GHG emissions per worker and energy consumption per worker are the same within industries across the country. In reality, the occupational structure and carbon intensity of an industry is likely to vary across regions. It also reflects resident, not workplace, employment patterns. \n\n\nOur London apportion estimates also exclude GHG emissions from consumer expenditure and only covers direct emissions by industry. Further analysis of indirect emissions across supply chains could be of value when considering the longer-term challenges faced by the economy as part of this transition. \n.

The aim was to trial innovative solutions for the light freight sector that allows it to adapt to changing regulatory and market conditions, mitigating congestion and emissions impacts. The three trials were:\nAgile 1: Multi-carrier consolidation trial\nIn the Agile Gnewt Cargo trial, the demonstrator carried parcels for final delivery in central London for several major parcels businesses (namely Hermes, TNT and DX, all of which are active in business-to-consumer (B2C), home deliveries, and business-to-business (B2B) operations in London and the UK). The area covered focuses around the London Congestion charge area with a keen focus on the west side of this highly polluted region.\n \nAgile 2: IT solutions for parcel deliveries trial\nThe trial was designed to test a range of IT solutions for electric fleet management, improving efficient client communication management and routing and planning systems. \n \nAgile 3: Single-carrier consolidation trial\nThe trial explored scenarios for consolidating deliveries of multiple retail and non- retail clients using a single carrier (Gnewt Cargo) in a single van. All deliveries were done using electric vans. The aim of the trial was to reduce the number of delivery trips, reduce congestion and improve air quality outputs compared to a diesel equivalent approach by utilizing zero emissions electric freight delivery vehicles.\nFor each trial there is a Final Report, a Data Report and a spreadsheet containing the raw data used in the reports. .

Summary: The London Energy and Greenhouse Gas Inventory (LEGGI) is an emissions inventory which quantifies greenhouse gas emissions released to the environment from activities in London. It also quantifies emissions removed through Land Use, Land Change and Forestry sector activities.\nIt is produced on an annual basis to measure progress against the Mayor's emissions reduction targets for London.\nThe inventory provides emissions in the following five categories:\nI. Stationary Energy\nII. Transport\nIII. Waste\nIV. Industrial processes and product use (IPPU)\nV. Agriculture, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU)\nPublications earlier than the 2018 LEGGI only included emissions in the first two of these categories. However, LEGGI now provides estimates of these additional sectors for earlier years.\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the resulting restrictions introduced in 2020 across London and the UK had major impacts on various aspects of society and the economy, which had a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions. 2020 statistics should therefore be cited with caution.\nIn 2022, London’s emissions were 28.40 million tonnes (MtCO  2  e). Over the short-term, emissions went down from 31.94 MtCO  2  e in 2019 (pre-pandemic), to 28.37MtCO  2  e in 2021 and then in 2022 there was a very small ‘pandemic rebound effect’ as emissions increased to 28.40 MtCO  2  e. \nOver the longer term, emissions are 37 per cent lower than 1990 levels and 44 per cent below the peak of emissions in 2000.

Summary: \nEach year, London's fire and rescue authority is required to prepare an annual Statement of Assurance (SoA) in accordance with the Fire and Rescue National Framework for England. This is to \" provide annual assurance on financial, governance and operational matters \". The format of the Statement follows guidance produced by the government (May 2013). \n\n\nGovernance of London's fire and rescue service changed on 1 April 2018, when the former London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority (LFEPA) was abolished and the London Fire Commissioner (LFC) became the fire and rescue authority for London. The LFC runs the  London Fire Brigade  (LFB). The SoAs for 2017/18 onwards will be approved by the  LFC - see the LFC decisions page  here ; SoAs up to and including 2016/17 were approved by the former LFEPA . \n\nFrom the statement for 2014/15, the Brigade has published supporting data as an appendix to the Statement. This page includes the supporting data for SoAs from that date. Originally, this data was to help assess the impact of the changes to fire stations and fire engines made on 9 January 2014 and agreed as part of the Fifth London Safety Plan (LSP5). Also, the impact of removing a 13 further fire engines from service in June 2016 (as part of the budget savings for 2016/17). \n\nThe SoA for the preceding financial year (April to March) is normally published in the Autumn. Data sets that support the latest SoA are palso published here.\n\nThe LFB has published full datasets for incidents attended since January 2009, plus a dataset which details of every fire engine (pumping appliance) sent to an incident. These datasets, which are updated on a monthly basis, are:\n\n\n\nLFB incident attended  since January 2009.\n\n\nFire engine mobilisations  since January 2009.\n\n. Published by David Wyatt.

Rents data are based on the financial year.\nStock figures used to estimate the average for each county, region and the nation are taken at 1st April of the following financial year. Average rents data between 2003/04 and 2007/08 inclusively is based on total stock figures from Housing Revenue Account (HRA) audited base claim form. Before 2003/04 the average rents data is based on total stock figures from the Housing Revenue Account (HRA) second subsidy claim form.\nRents data for 2008/09 are based on total stock figures as at the beginning of the financial year. This data is taken from the HRA subsidy base data form. Average rent data for this year are provisional and will be updated when stock data at the start of the following financial year become available.\nFor a few authorities no rent figure is given because the stock is now very small and the authority no longer reports average rents. For some local authorities the average rent for 2003/04 is lower than in 2002/03. This may be due to some local authorities supplying net rents excluding service charges from 2003/04 onwards. Prior to 2003/04 some of them may have been including service charges in their rent figures. Average rent figures do not account for stock composition.\n'LSVT': all or most of the local authority stock has been transferred to the RSL sector, so the average rent is no longer applicable. LSVTs are not taken into account when calculating county, regional or national averages. MYT (Mid-Year Transfer) refers to those authorities that have transferred their stock in full, part way through the financial year.\nWhere a local authority has transferred part of it's stock mid-year, the stock figure used to estimate averages is taken as at 1st April the following financial year. MYT information is provided from 2003/04 onwards only. Prior to 2003/04 average rents figures may be based on stock figures at the start of the financial year prior to any mid-year transfer.\nThe districts, unitary authorities and counties listed above are based on 1 April 1998 boundaries. Figures for any 'new' re-organised areas have been estimated retrospectively applying the new boundaries back to 1996. Average rents data for 2003/04 and onwards are based on a standardised 52 week collection. Data prior to 2003/04 may have been reported on various different collection scales.

        "embedding_text": "Title: Local Authority Maintained Trees. Summary: This dataset includes the locations and species information for over 880,000 of London's trees. It also includes additional information such as size and age for some of these trees. These are predominantly street trees, but also some trees in parks and other open spaces.\nThe data does not represent the entirety of the capital's urban forest - the London iTree report estimated that there are over eight million trees in London, which includes trees in woodlands, parks, streets, private gardens and more. The data includes 26 of London's 33 boroughs, the City of London and Transport for London.\nAs recognised in the London Urban Forest Plan, collating data about London's urban forest is challenging due to the number of landowners and managers involved, as well as the limited resources available. The Plan committed to undertaking regular updates to this map, and also, over time, to collating a London-wide inventory of publicly owned and managed trees, in line with emerging national standards.\nThe data is used on the London Street Tree Map.\n\nNotes on the data:\n\nThe data on the map includes data provided in 2014-15, during initial data collection, and updated data provided in 2019-20. Where boroughs did not provide updated data in 2019-20, the 2014-15 data has been retained. However, trees may have been surveyed some time before this and so some records may be several years old.\nThe map includes data from 26 of the London boroughs, the City of London and Transport for London (TfL). TfL trees are shown London-wide.\nData has not been received to date from six boroughs. We aim to add any additional data received to the  Datastore  and online map.\nSome large gaps on the map are due to large green spaces (including the Royal Parks), reservoirs, or airports, as well as those boroughs where data is missing.\nThe data received varies significantly by borough. Some boroughs have only included trees on highways, whilst others have included trees on housing land, in schools or in parks. In some cases trees were recorded only when work was carried out.\nThere is not a consistent or agreed format for collecting or recording tree data across London. This presents a challenge in collating data across multiple boroughs. Many boroughs collect a range of information about their trees (e.g. age, height). However this varied by borough in terms of the information collected and categorisations used so we were not able to standardise this information.\nTree species data has been standardised the names to come up with a simplified common name for display on the tree webmap (e. g. “Pear”). These are the common names for the 24 types of tree appearing most frequently in the data (which encompass 90% of all trees), with the remaining trees categorised as “Other”. We have also left the species name as provided by the borough in the data.\nThe ‘tree ID’ number has been added to the data to help map it. This number is not linked to borough’s tree management systems.\n\n\n\n\n   \n\nWarning: Large file size may result in a long download time\n. Published by GLA Environment Team. Tags: No tags.

Care should therefore be taken in interpreting the survey findings. For all estimates, lower and upper limits of 95% confidence intervals are provided in the data files to assist with interpretation. The LBS results represent the population of business units in London. A business unit is defined as a site/workplace, which may also be a head office if the head office is in London. It will be the whole business in the case of businesses which only have one site, or part of the business in the case of multi-site firms.\nThe results are presented by enterprise size band and industry sector..

Summary: This dataset presents results of a weekly questionnaire sent to a cohort of frontline civil society organisations from April 2020. The results are being used alongside a range of other pieces of intelligence to inform the pan-London response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe week one questionnaire asked organisations a number of profile questions to understand more about the work they do.\nQuestionnaires from week two onwards have asked organisations about patterns of need they are seeing amongst their beneficiary groups in the last week. Responses to these questions are linked back to the week one profile questions, where possible, to understand how responses vary between different types of organisations.\nThis is also an ongoing 'on-boarding' questionnaire sent to new members of the cohort. This replicates the profile questions in the week one questionnaire, allowing the cohort to grow over time.\nThe cohort was recruited using contacts already held by the Greater London Authority, and also incorporated a 'snowball sampling' technique whereby larger infrastructure organisations were encouraged to forward the invite to smaller organisations they work with.\nWhen reading these results, it is important to bear in mind that the cohort is relatively small and not fully representative of all civil society organisations in London. For these reasons, the results should be used alongside other pieces of intelligence and should not be used to make claims about civil society in London as a whole.\nIf you represent a civil society organisation and would like to take part, please email us at civilsociety@london.gov.uk.

It set out the Mayor’s ambition to make London the greenest global city.\nThe Report to the Mayor provides a high-level summary and analysis of the issues raised during the consultation of the draft strategy, from both technical stakeholders and members of the public. This allowed the Mayor to have proper regard to the consultation responses when deciding whether to approve the final version of the strategy.\nThe public responded to the consultation via Talk London online discussion threads and surveys; and via focus groups, interviews, and representative polling. The Talk London datasets and emailed responses were analysed by policy area, and compared against insights from the representative polling and offline qualitative research (focus groups and interviews). This allowed the team to identify any similarities or differences between the views of the general population and the views of the Talk London community.\nAll datasets on a policy area were brought together in a single thematic summary report, which aimed to show where the balance of opinion lay, as well as highlight areas of disagreement or debate.

LFB agree with the Mayor of London that this is necessary in order to address any inequalities and reduce gaps where these are evident.\n\nThe Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017 requires that the London Fire Brigade publish the difference between the rate of pay of male and female full-pay employees to show any gender pay gap. Annual data is available from March 2016.\n\n\nAnd, although it is not a statutory requirement, the LFB also publish ethnicity and disability (from 2021) pay gap data in line with good practice. Annual data for ethnicity  is available annually from March 2017.\n\n\nWith effect from 1 April 2018, the individual holding the office of London Fire Commissioner (LFC) is appointed by the Mayor of London and is not an LFB employee. However, in the interests of transparency, the London Fire Commissioner has been taken into account for the purposes of reporting this pay gap data.\n. Published by David Wyatt. Tags: No tags.

Summary: These fuel poverty risk indicators provide users with a nuanced picture of the impact of various risk factors, exacerbating factors and indicators for fuel poverty. It was developed with the Assembly Health and Public Services Committee in their investigation into fuel poverty in London. The Committee's report explains how the tool could be used strategically to help organisations target specific wards that are at high risk of fuel poverty. Appendix 4 in the report set out the rationale for the risk factors present in the tool.\nUsers can adjust the weighting of the indicators to show their relative significance. Isolating specific indicators could help organisations determine what type of support is likely to have greatest impact in an area. For example, wards with a low score for cavity wall insulation would indicate wards that could be targeted for promoting uptake of cavity wall insulation.\nRead Victoria Borwick's blog \"Using public data to tackle fuel poverty - can you help?\"\nThe fuel poverty scores measure risk of fuel poverty based on 12 indicators. The England and Wales average each year is 0. Scores below 0 are more likely to be at risk from fuel poverty according to these measures.\nThe indicators are:\nHousing  Dwellings without central heating Cavity walls that are uninsulated Lofts with less than 150mm insulation\nHealth  Health Deprivation & Disability domain (ID2010) Standardised Mortality Ratio Incapacity Benefit claimant rate\nOlder people  People aged 60 and over Older people claiming pension credit\nWorklessness  Unemployment\nPoverty Income Support claimant rate Child Poverty rates Households classified 'fuel poor'\nThe Excel tool includes a ward map, charts and rankings.\nNote: Users must enable macros when prompted upon opening the spreadsheet (or reset security to medium/low) for the map to function.

Summary: London Heat Map\nThe London Heat Map is a tool designed to help you identify areas of high heat demand, explore opportunities for new and expanding district heat networks and to draw potential heat networks and assess their financial feasibility.\nThe new version of the London Heat Map was created for the Greater London Authority by the Centre for Sustainable Energy (CSE) in July 2019. The London Heat Map is regularly updated with new network data and other datasets. Background datasets such as building heat demand was last updated on 26/06/2023.\nThe London Heatmap is a map-based web application you can use to find and appraise opportunities for decentralised energy (DE) projects in London.\nThe map covers the whole of Greater London, and provides very local information to help you identify and develop DE opportunities, including data such as:\n\nHeat demand values for each building\nLocations of potential heat supply sites\nLocations of existing and proposed district heating networks\nA spatial heat demand density map layer\n\nThe map also includes a user-friendly visual tool for heat network design. This is intended to support preliminary techno-economic appraisal of potential district heat networks.\nThe London Heat Map is used by a wide variety of people in numerous ways:\n\nLondon Boroughs can use the new map to help develop their energy master plans.\nProperty developers can use the map to help them meet the decentralised energy policies in the London Plan.\nEnergy consultants can use the map to gather initial data to inform feasibility studies.\n\nMore information is available here, and an interactive map is available here.\nBuilding-level estimated annual and peak heat demand data from the London Heat Map has been made available through the data extracts below. The data was last updated on 26/06/2023. The data contains Ordnance Survey mapping and the data is published under Ordnance Survey's 'presumption to publish'. © Crown copyright and database rights 2023.\n\nThe Decentralised Energy Master planning programme (DEMaP)\nThe Decentralised Energy Master planning programme (DEMaP), was completed in October 2010. It included a heat mapping support package for the London boroughs to enable them to carry out high resolution heat mapping for their area.\nTo date, heat maps have been produced for 29 London boroughs with the remaining four boroughs carrying out their own data collection. All of the data collected through this process is provided below.\nCarbon Calculator Tool\nArup have produced a Carbon Calculator Tool to assist projects in their early estimation of the carbon dioxide (CO2) savings which could be realised by a district heating scheme with different sources of heating.\nThe calculator's estimates include the impact of a decarbonising the electrical grid over time, based on projections by the Department for Energy and Climate Change, as well as the Government's Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP).\nThe Excel-based tool can be downloaded below.\nBorough Heat Maps Data and Reports (2012)\nIn March 2012, all London boroughs did a heat mapping exercise. The data from this includes the following and can be downloaded below:\n\nHeat Load for all boroughs\nHeat Supplies for all boroughs\nHeat Network\nLDD 2010 database\nComplete GIS London Heat Map Data\n\nThe heat maps contain real heat consumption data for priority buildings such as hospitals, leisure centres and local authority buildings.\nAs part of this work, each of the boroughs developed implementation plans to help them take the DE opportunities identified to the next stages. The implementation plans include barriers and opportunities, actions to be taken by the council, key dates, personnel responsible.

The impact of these emissions goes far beyond the city’s boundaries. From the electronics we buy and the food we eat to the clothes we wear, most are produced and transported globally.\n\n\nThe Mayor, together with London Councils and ReLondon, has jointly commissioned Leeds University to develop a historic trend of consumption-based emissions for London. It uses the latest available data (running from 2001-2021) on average expenditure on different types of goods and services. This methodology aligns with equivalent national government datasets at the UK level.\n\nFindings\n\n\nLondon’s consumption-based emissions in 2021 were around 80 MtCO\n2\ne. They’ve fallen by 24 per cent since 2001, despite the city’s population increasing by 1.4 million over that time. This means emissions per head have reduced by 35 per cent (from 13.9 to 8.98 tCO\n2\ne per person). \n\n The biggest drop in consumption-based emissions was between 2008 and 2009 during the global financial crisis, when households’ average spending decreased. Post 2009, emissions stabilised then steadily reduced from 2014 to 2020, bar a small increase from 2017-2018. This period of emissions reduction has been mainly driven by decarbonisation of the UK electricity sector. \n\n\nThe national context\n\n\nLondon’s per capita consumption-based footprint is slightly lower than the UK average. It also follows a similar trend in reduction over the same period. However, at a sector level there are some cases where the per capita emissions for Londoners are different, for example:\n\n\n\nTransport – London’s use of transport is unlike any other region in the UK. Private transport emissions are much lower than any other region, and public transport emissions are the highest in the country. As a result, London has the lowest per capita transport emissions of any region and is lower than the UK average. However, London also has one of the highest per capita aviation emissions. Transport emissions were still unusually low in 2021 due to the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nHousing, water, electricity, gas, other fuels – Compared to other regions in the UK, Londoners spend less on heating and power. This is a function of increased household occupancy rather than lower energy bills and more efficient homes.\n\nFood and drink – Compared to other regions in the UK, Londoners spend less on meat, which contributes to a lower food footprint per capita.\n\n\nThe international context\n\nThe Mayor wants to recognise the full environmental impact of London’s consumption by publishing this data. We hope this will encourage more cities to publish their consumption-based emissions data so we can identify similarities and work together to bring these emissions down. .

Summary: For an urban heat island map during an average summer see this dataset.\nA heatwave refers to a prolonged period of unusually hot weather. While there is no standard definition of a heatwave in England, the Met Office uses the World Meteorological Organization definition of a heatwave, which is \"when the daily maximum temperature of more than five consecutive days exceeds the average maximum temperature by 5°C, the normal period being 1961-1990\". They are common in the northern and southern hemisphere during summer have historically been associated with health problems and an increase in mortality.\nThe urban heat island (UHI) is the phenomenon where temperatures are relatively higher in cities compared to surrounding rural areas due to, for example, the urban surfaces and anthropogenic heat sources.\nThis urban heat island map was produced using LondUM, a specific set-up of the Met Office Unified Model version 6.1 for London. It uses the Met Office Reading Surface Exchange Scheme (MORUSES), as well as urban morphology data derived from Virtual London. The model was run from May until September 2006 and December 2006. This map shows average surface temperatures over the summer period of 2006 at a 1km by 1km resolution. To find out more about LondUM, see the University of Reading’s website.\nThe hourly outputs from LondUM have been aggregated and mapped by Jonathon Taylor, UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering. Variables include:\n\nWSAVGMAX= the average of the maximum daily temperatures across the summer period (May 26th-August 31st)\nWSAVG=the average temperature across the summer period\nWSAVGMIN = the average minimum daily temperature across the summer period\nHWAVGMAX= the average of the maximum daily temperatures across the 2006 heatwave (July 16th-19th)\nHWAVG=the average temperature across the across the 2006 heatwave\nHWAVGMIN = the average minimum daily temperature across 2006 heatwave period\n\nThe maps are also available as one combined PDF.\nThe gif below maps the temperatures across London during the four-day period of 16-19th July, which was considered a heatwave.\nIf you make use of the LondUM data, please use the following citation to acknowledge the data and reference the publication below for model description:\nLondUM (2011).

Average monthly evening peak temperatures since 2013 are provided on this page.\nWe are investing millions as part of a long-term programme to ensure we can deliver more services, and continue to introduce new trains to meet growing customer numbers whilst providing more comfortable journeys. We have implemented energy efficient solutions on new trains, which saves energy and reduces the heat generated. We have also removed heat from our station and tunnel environment by installing new ventilation or cooling solutions.\nOn the Central line we have installed solar reflective material on the external surface of train roofs and solar reducing films on windows to minimise solar gains into the carriages.\nOn the Victoria line we have doubled the capacity of thirteen ventilation shafts, which provide more air flow, as well as introduced regenerative braking (which returns power to the rails while the train is braking) on the new trains. We have also installed air cooling units and mechanical chillers at some key busy stations, such as Oxford Circus, and have been using groundwater underneath Victoria Tube station to provide cooling to the platforms. We are similarly using water from the aquifer underneath Green Park to provide cooling for that Tube station. In addition, we have upgraded existing ventilation fans and installed new fans at a number of stations across the network.\nAs part of this work to make customer journeys more comfortable, we are also working to reduce temperatures inside carriages. 192 new air-conditioned trains are now in operation on the Circle, District, Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan lines.\n\nNote: Sub-surface lines are the Circle, Hammersmith & City, District and Metropolitan lines..

Summary: These ward level well being scores present a combined measure of well-being indicators of the resident population based on 12 different indicators. Where possible each indicator score is compared with the England and Wales average, which is zero. Scores over 0 indicate a higher probability that the population on average will experience better well-being according to these measures.\nUsers can adjust the weight of each indicator depending on what they consider to be the more or less important, thus generating bespoke scores. This is done either by entering a number between 0 and 10. The scores throughout the spreadsheet will update automatically.\nThe tool combines data across a range of themes for the last five years of available data (2009-2013).\nEither view the results in the online interactive tool here,\n\n\n\n\n\nOr download the interactive spreadsheet here \n\n\n\nThe well-being scores are then presented in a ranked bar chart for each borough, and a ward map of London.\nThe spreadsheet also highlights wards in the top and bottom 25 per cent in London. Wards that have shown significant improvement or reduction in their scores relative to the average over the five year period are also highlighted.\nBorough figures are provided to assist with comparisons.\nRankings and summary tables are included. The source data that the tool is based on is included in the spreadsheet.\nThe Excel file is 8.1MB.\nIMPORTANT NOTE, users must enable macros when prompted upon opening the Excel spreadsheet (or reset security to medium/low) for the map to function. The rest of the tool will function without macros.\nIf you cannot download the Excel file directly try this zip file (2.6MB).\nIf you experience any difficulties with downloading this spreadsheet, please contact the London Datastore in the Intelligence Unit.\nDetailed information about definitions and sources is contained within the spreadsheet.\nThe 12 measures included are:\nHealth \n - Life Expectancy\n - Childhood Obesity\n - Incapacity Benefits claimant rate\nEconomic security\n - Unemployment rate\nSafety\n - Crime rate\n - Deliberate Fires\nEducation\n - GCSE point scores\nChildren\n - Unauthorised Pupil Absence\nFamilies\n - Children in out-of-work households\nTransport\n - Public Transport Accessibility Scores (PTALs)\nEnvironment\n - Access to public open space & nature\nHappiness\n - Composite Subjective Well-being Score (Life Satisfaction, Worthwhileness, Anxiety, and Happiness) (New data only available since 2011/12)\nWith some measures if the data shows a high figure that indicates better well-being, and with other measures a low figure indicates better well-being. Therefore scores for Life Expectancy, GCSE scores, PTALs, and Access to Public Open Space/Nature have been reversed so that in all measures low scores indicate probable lower well-being.\nThe data has been turned into scores where each indicator in each year has a standard deviation of 10. This means that each indicator will have an equal effect on the final score when the weightings are set to equal.\nWhy should measuring well-being be important to policy makers? \n Following research by the Cabinet Office and Office for National Statistics, the government is aiming to develop policy that is more focused on ‘all those things that make life worthwhile’ (David Cameron, November 2010). They are interested in developing new and better ways to understand how policy and public services affect well-being.\nWhy measure well-being for local areas?\n It is important for London policy makers to consider well-being at a local level (smaller than borough level) because of the often huge differences within boroughs. Local authorities rely on small area data in order to target resources, and with local authorities currently gaining more responsibilities from government, this is of increasing importance. But small area data is also of interest to academics, independent analysts and members of the public with an interest in the subject of well-being.\nHow can well-being be measured within small areas?\n The Office for National Statistics have been developing new measures of national well-being, and as part of this, at a national and regional level, the ONS has published some subjective data to measure happiness. ONS have not measured well-being for small areas, so this tool has been designed to fill this gap. However, DCLG have published a tool that models life satisfaction data for LSOAs based on a combination of national level happiness data, and 'ACORN' data. Happiness data is not available for small areas because there are no surveys large enough for this level of detail, and so at this geography the focus is on objective indicators. Data availability for small areas is far more limited than for districts, and this means the indicators that the scores are based on are not all perfect measures of well-being, though they are the best available. However, by using a relatively high number of measures across a number of years, this increases the reliability of the well-being scores.\nHow can this tool be used to help policy makers?\n Each neighbourhood will have its own priorities, but the data in this tool could help provide a solid evidence base for informed local policy-making, and the distribution of regeneration funds. In addition, it could assist users to identify the causes behind an improvement in well-being in certain wards, where examples of good practice could be applied elsewhere.\nDifferences to the previous report\nThis is the 2013 edition of this publication, and there is one change from 2012. Indicators of Election turnout has been replaced with a composite score of subjective well-being indicators.\nPast versions are still available for 2011 and 2012. The rationale/methodology paper from 2011 is here. The scores from the 2012 spreadsheet are also available in PDF format. The scores in Intelligence Update 21-2012 are based on equal weightings across each measure.\nThis tool was created by the GLA Intelligence Unit.

        "embedding_text": "Title: London's Population. Summary: Introduction\nThe 2023 mid-year estimate (MYE) is the current official estimate of the population for local authorities in England and Wales. Estimates are produced annually by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and the 2023 MYE was published on 15 July 2024.\nComparison to previous MYE data\nThe previous MYE series (for the period 2012-2020) starts with the 2011 census estimate. Each subsequent year’s population is calculated by adding estimates of births, deaths and migration to the previous year’s population. The 2021 MYE represents a break in this series as it uses the 2021 census as its base.\nThe ONS revised the 2012-2020 MYE series to bring it in line with the 2021 MYE, so that comparisons could be made between between this series and the previous series. The values plotted on the chart are the revised values of the previously published estimates for 2011 to 2022, together with the estimates for 2023.\nKey Points\n\nLondon’s mid-2023 population was 8.945 million\n\nLondon’s population increased by 76,300 persons compared to the previous mid-year value\nComponents of change were as follows:\n105,100 births and 53,500 deaths (natural change of 51,600)\nNet domestic migration was an outflow of 129,200\nNet international migration was an inflow of 154,100\n\nPopulation Change\nLondon’s 2023 population was 8,945,310. The first chart below shows the 2023 MYE in the context of previous estimates. There is an uptick after a temporary decrease in population which we attribute to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\nComponents of Change\nBirths, deaths and migration form the components of population change.\nThe 2023 MYE value for births was 4% lower than that in 2022, and for deaths 3% higher. The consequent value for natural change (births - deaths) was 10% lower than in 2022.\nAt -129,000, the value for domestic migration (migration within the UK) was nearly 3% higher than the 2022 value, so still significantly lower than the peak net outflow during the COVID-19 pandemic of -186,000. An outflow of domestic migrants from London is normal and this has been the case each year for the last two decades. This flow is partly because many international in-migrants initially settle in London before moving out to other parts of the UK. The second move in this sequence is counted as a domestic migration.\nThere has been a marked change in immigration since 2021. This can be attributed to the end of free movement for EU nationals, easing of travel restrictions following the COVID\u000219 pandemic, and the war in Ukraine. At over 150,000, the 2023 MYE value for London’s net international migration was more than 18% higher than 2022, and represents a considerable increase from 78,000 in 2021.\n\n\n\nAge structure of the population\n\n\nFuture Updates\nThe release of the next mid-year estimates is expected in July 2025.\nThe full ONS mid-year population estimates release and back series can be found on the ONS website: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates.\nFor information relating to London’s population see the demography pages of the London Datastore: https://data.london.gov.uk/demography/ or email demography@london.gov.uk.\nAn in-depth review of the available evidence for population change in London since the start of the coronavirus pandemic has been produced by GLA Demography: https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/population-change-in-london-during-the-pandemic..

Summary: \n\n\n\n\nThe LSDC’s fourth Quality of Life Indicators report was launched at City Hall on 30th January 2013. The report provides a snapshot of London’s quality of life and identifies the sustainability issues London faces. The indicator set encompasses 33 headline indicators across the environmental, social and economic spheres. It provides baseline data that will inform the Commission’s future work programme and advice to the Mayor.\nThe Mayor wants London to be the best big city in the world. The London Sustainable Development Commission supports this aspiration and believes that as part of being ‘best’ we should work to make London the benchmark for sustainable cities by 2020. To improve our chances of achieving this we need first to know what this would mean in economic, environmental and social terms; where we currently stand; and then measure progress against these issues.\nThe LSDC produced the first Quality of Life Indicators Report in 2004 and subsequent reports were produced in 2005 and 2009.

GLA Economics has published a new working paper that provides up-to-date analysis and data with key findings including:\n\nLondon faces a long-term sickness challenge. 920,000, or 15%, of working-age Londoners, have a long-term health condition limiting the type or amount of work they can do. \nOne-in-10 employed Londoners report a health condition, leading to around 1 million of work hours lost through sickness absences annually. \nEconomic inactivity resulting from long-term sickness has grown in London since the pandemic – but much more slowly than in the rest of the UK. \nThe rise of mental health issues among young adults in London has been a key driver of the rise in work-limiting long-term sickness in the capital.\n.

Summary: During the pandemic, the loss of expenditure in London’s Central Activities Zone (CAZ) due to both workers staying at home and tourists being unable or choosing not to visit has had a major impact on the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors.\nThis analysis seeks to investigate the relative importance of these two cohorts to the CAZ. We estimate local expenditure from commuters to the CAZ in 2020, in a scenario with and without Covid-19. We compare this difference to the anticipated drop in inbound and domestic tourist expenditure in 2020, which we estimate by adjusting forecasts for London produced by Visit Britain.\nWe estimate a £10.9bn loss in tourism expenditure in the CAZ (£3.5bn domestic and £7.4bn inbound) compared to a £1.9bn loss in expenditure from commuters to the CAZ (£1.4bn of this expenditure is from commuters from London and £0.5bn is from commuters outside of London). .

The average population of an LSOA in London in 2010 was 1,722 compared with 8,346 for an MSOA and 13,078 for a ward.\nThe profiles are designed to provide an overview of the population in these small areas by combining a range of data on the population, diversity, households, health, housing, crime, benefits, land use, deprivation, schools, and employment.\nDue to significant population change in some areas, not all 2011 LSOA boundaries are the same as previous LSOA boundaries that had been used from 2001. A lot of data is still only available using the 2001 boundaries therefore two Atlases have been created - one using the current LSOA boundaries (2011) and one using the previous boundaries (2001).\nIf you need to find an LSOA and you know the postcode of the area, the ONS NESS search page has a tool for this.\nThe LSOA Atlas is available as an XLS as well as being presented using InstantAtlas mapping software. This is a useful tool for displaying a large amount of data for numerous geographies, in one place (requires HTML 5).\nFor 2011 Census data used in the 2001 Boundaries Atlas: For simplicity, where two or more areas have been merged, the figures for these areas have been divided by the number of LSOAs that used to make that area up. Therefore, these data are not official ONS statisitcs, but presented here as indicative to display trends.\nNB. It is currently not possible to export the map as a picture due to a software issue with the Google Maps background. We advise you to print screen to copy an image to the clipboard.\nIMPORTANT: Due to the large amount of data and areas, the LSOA Atlas may take up to a minute to fully load. Once loaded, the report will work more efficiently by using the filter tool and selecting one borough at a time. Displaying every LSOA in London will slow down the data reload.\nTips:\n\n- Select a new indicator from the Data box on the left. Select the theme, then indicator and then year to show the data.\n- To view data just for one borough, use the filter tool.\n- The legend settings can be altered by clicking on the pencil icon next to the LSOA tick box within the map legend.\n- The areas can be ranked in order by clicking at the top of the indicator column of the data table.\n\nBeware of large file size for 2001 Boundary Atlas (58MB) alternatively download Zip file (21MB).\nThemes included in the atlases are Census 2011 population, Mid-year Estimates by age, Population Density, Households, Household Composition, Ethnic Group, Language, Religion, Country of Birth, Tenure, Number of dwellings, Vacant Dwellings, Dwellings by Council Tax Band, Crime (numbers), Crime (rates), Economic Activity, Qualifications, House Prices, Workplace employment numbers, Claimant Count, Employment and Support Allowance, Benefits claimants, State Pension, Pension Credit, Incapacity Benefit/ SDA, Disability Living Allowance, Income Support, Financial vulnerability, Health and Disability, Land use, Air Emissions, Energy consumption, Car or Van access, Accessibility by Public Transport/walk, Road Casualties, Child Benefit, Child Poverty, Lone Parent Families, Out-of-Work families, Fuel Poverty, Free School Meals, Pupil Absence, Early Years Foundation Stage, Key Stage 1, Key Stage 2, GCSE, Level 3 (e.g A/AS level), The Indices of Deprivation 2010, Economic Deprivation Index, and The IMD 2010 Underlying Indicators.\nThe London boroughs are: City of London, Barking and Dagenham, Barnet, Bexley, Brent, Bromley, Camden, Croydon, Ealing, Enfield, Greenwich, Hackney, Hammersmith and Fulham, Haringey, Harrow, Havering, Hillingdon, Hounslow, Islington, Kensington and Chelsea, Kingston upon Thames, Lambeth, Lewisham, Merton, Newham, Redbridge, Richmond upon Thames, Southwark, Sutton, Tower Hamlets, Waltham Forest, Wandsworth, Westminster.\nThese profiles were created using the most up to date information available at the time of collection (Spring 2014).\nYou may also be interested in MSOA Atlas and Ward Atlas..

Summary: Fine resolution satellite thermal data can be used as a basis for mapping the spatial distribution of urban surface temperatures and identifying urban hotspots. This dataset has been produced from satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST) data for the Greater London Area by ARTi Analytics BV as part of EXTREMA Global portfolio of services and reveals the city’s major daytime summertime hotspots.\n\n\n\n\nOutline methodology\n\nFor spatial resolutions coarser than 30 m it can be reasonably assumed that the urban LST hotspots coincide with the urban air temperature hotspots1. Hence, thermal satellite data can be used so as to identify intra-urban areas with elevated temperatures.\nTo generate a dataset that presents the LST spatial distribution and the corresponding hotspots for GLA, a five-year (2016-2020) time series of satellite-derived 100 m daytime LST images (in °C) is employed. The utilized data correspond only to summer months (i.e. June, July and August) so as to capture the hotspots with the most important impact on thermal discomfort, human health and energy demand, and are derived from Landsat-8 thermal infrared images.\nThe next step after estimating the 2016-2020, average, summertime, daytime LST is to aggregate them to city block level. In addition to the average LST (avgLST), the avgLST standard deviation, minimum and maximum for each city block are also estimated. The aforementioned statistics are stored as new attributes in the Urban Atlas polygons and the updated vectors are then exported as a new shapefile. The spatial extent of this output shapefile corresponds to the boundaries of GLA.. Published by GLA Environment Team. Tags: urban heat island. Temporal Coverage: None - None.

Summary: Image: Snapshot from the Map of Community Views\n\n\n\n\nTo understand different communities’ experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, Deputy Mayor for Social Integration, Social Mobility and Community Engagement, Dr Debbie Weekes-Bernard and the GLA Community Engagement Team convened a series of virtual roundtable conversations and community meetings with groups and community leaders between April and September 2020.\n\n\n \n\n\nThese conversations covered a range of complex issues. We heard about the overexposure of Black and Asian Minority Ethnic communities to the pandemic because they often work in frontline roles; the upsurge in hate crime against East and South East Asian Londoners; heightened need for domestic abuse support and better community language translations including specific dialects; the deep impact the virus has had on specific groups such as Somali, Bengali and Pakistani Londoners, particularly because of challenges with housing arrangements; the challenges for families around education for many groups including Gypsy, Roma, Traveller communities; concerns for LGBT+, Younger and Older Londoners; the impact of the Black Lives Matter movement; faith communities having to adapt their services and facing loss of income as a result, and much more. It was clear throughout that grassroots Faith and Community groups have played a crucial role meeting essential needs.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe map of community views does not name specific groups but captures themes that can be addressed at policy level in close partnership with those affected, by recognising the strength of London’s community sector. \n\n\n\n\n\n 21 Roundtables and Community Meetings \n\n\n 250 Civil society and community groups reached\n.

Summary: Since 2014 the GLA’s Regeneration Unit have been developing and delivering an innovative and pioneering new tool to support local investment in London’s communities: The Mayor’s Crowdfunding Programme. The initiative explores the potential for the GLA to pledge to civic crowdfunding projects as ‘one of the crowd’, enabling London’s citizens to deliver and manage spaces and places that suit local needs and identities.\nThis study, commissioned by the Regeneration Unit and undertaken by the GLA’s Opinion Research team, attends to the ‘softer’ social impacts of regeneration interventions that can be easily overlooked in traditional evaluative research for policy. Significantly, the report deals only and entirely with non-financial benefits of civic crowdfunding, attending to a gap in research previously identified by Nesta (2015). Through a period of qualitative research, specifically semi-structured interviews and non-participant observation, with a sample of 7 project groups, insight and understanding has been gathered on the experiences of those who embark on delivering a project as part of the Mayor’s Crowdfunding Programme.\nTechnical Details\n\nResults and findings are based on in depth qualitative research with 7 project groups funded in Rounds 1 or 2 of the Mayor’s Crowdfunding Programme.\nResearch was undertaken on projects’ sites throughout May of 2016.\nAll data collection was undertaken with the same template, by the same researcher. All data was thematically coded into one data-set.\nParticipants were self-selecting, from the pool of funded projects.

Please use the UK House Price Index instead.\nMix-adjusted house prices, by new/pre-owned dwellings, type of buyer (first time buyer) and region, from February 2002 for London and UK, and average mix-adjusted prices by UK region, and long term Annual House Price Index data since 1969 for London.\nThe ONS House Price Index is mix-adjusted to allow for differences between houses sold (for example type, number of rooms, location) in different months within a year. House prices are modelled using a combination of characteristics to produce a model containing around 100,000 cells (one such cell could be first-time buyer, old dwelling, one bedroom flat purchased in London). Each month estimated prices for all cells are produced by the model and then combined with their appropriate weight to produce mix-adjusted average prices. The index values are based on growth rates in the mix-adjusted average house prices and are annually chain linked.\nThe weights used for mix-adjustment change at the start of each calendar year (i.e. in January). The mix-adjusted prices are therefore not comparable between calendar years, although they are comparable within each calendar year. If you wish to calculate change between years, you should use the mix-adjusted house price index, available in Table 33.\nThe data published in these tables are based on a sub-sample of RMS data. These results will therefore differ from results produced using full sample data. For further information please contact the ONS using the contact details below.  House prices, mortgage advances and incomes have been rounded to the nearest £1,000.  Data taken from Table 2 and Table 9 of the monthly ONS release.\nDownload from ONS website.

Summary: This is a Toynbee Hall report on adult education commissioned by the Greater London Authority (GLA) to inform the preparation of the Mayor’s Skills Roadmap for London. For this project Toynbee Hall worked with a group of peer researchers who had lived experience of being part of one or more of the priority groups identified by the GLA as having the most to gain from adult education.\nOver the course of five months peer researchers co-designed and co-produced the research and conducted in-depth interviews with over 50 people from across London about how adult education services could be improved. For this project Toynbee Hall adopted a Participatory Action Research (PAR) approach. This style of research involves professional researchers and members of communities (peer researchers) working in partnership to develop the project scope, carry out the data collection, and analyse the findings.\nAs an important aim of this project was to improve access to adult education, this research deliberately focused on the barriers experienced by those who participated in the study, and how they felt access to and engagement with adult education could be improved. The report also learns from the positive experiences that some interviewees shared and have referenced some of this good practice in it’s recommendations. It should be noted that as a qualitative piece of work interviews should not be taken as a statistically representative sample of all Londoners but rather an in-depth look at the experiences of some of the more marginalised of Londoners.\n\nClick here to read a blog from the peer researchers who conducted the research, speaking about the findings and their experiences of carrying out the project..

While there is no standard definition of a heatwave in England, the Met Office generally uses the World Meteorological Organization definition of a heatwave, which is \"when the daily maximum temperature of more than five consecutive days exceeds the average maximum temperature by 5°C, the normal period being 1961-1990\". They are common in the northern and southern hemisphere during summer, and have historically been associated with health problems and an increase in mortality.\nThe urban heat island (UHI) is the phenomenon where temperatures are relatively higher in cities compared to surrounding rural areas due to, for example, the urban surfaces and anthropogenic heat sources. For an example of an urban heat island map during an average summer, see this dataset. For an example of an urban heat island map during a warm summer, see this dataset.\nAs well as outdoor temperature, an individual’s heat exposure may also depend on the type of building they are inside, if indoors. Indoor temperature exposure may depend on a number of characteristics, such as the building geometry, construction materials, window sizes, and the ability to add extra ventilation. It is also known that people have different vulnerabilities to heat, with some more prone to negative health issues when exposed to high temperatures.\nThis Triple Jeopardy dataset combines:\n\nUrban Heat Island information for London, based on the 55 days between May 26th -July 19th 2006, where the last four days were considered a heatwave\nAn estimate of the indoor temperatures for individual dwellings in London across this time period\nPopulation age, as a proxy for heat vulnerability, and distribution\n\nFrom this, local levels of heat-related mortality were estimated using a mortality model derived from epidemiological data.\nThe dataset comprises four layers:\n\nInd_Temp_A – indoor Temperature Anomaly is the difference in degrees Celsius between the estimated indoor temperatures for dwellings and the average indoor temperature estimate for the whole of London, averaged by ward. Positive numbers show dwellings with a greater tendency to overheat in comparison with the London average\nHeatMortpM – total estimated mortality due to heat (outdoor and indoor) per million population over the entire 55 day period, inclusive of age effects\nHeatMorUHI – estimated mortality per million population due to increased outdoor temperature exposure caused by the UHI over the 55 day period (excluding the effect of overheating housing), inclusive of age effects\nHeatMorInd - estimated mortality per million population due to increased temperature exposure caused by heat-vulnerable dwellings (excluding the effect of the UHI) over the 55 day period, inclusive of age effects More information is on this website and in the Triple Jeopardy leaflet.\n\nThe maps are also available as one combined PDF.

Repossessions can occur without a court order being made, while not all court orders result in repossession taking place.\nThe data provided in each of the tables relate to possession claims issued and claims leading to an orders being made in the county courts in England and Wales.\nClaims Issued: A possession claim is created when a claimant begins a legal action for an order for possession of property by making a claim that is then issued in a county court.\nOrders: The court, following a judicial hearing may grant an order for immediate possession. This entitles the claimant to apply for a warrant to have the defendant evicted, except in the case of suspended orders where the order is suspended as long as the defendant complies with conditions specified in the order.\nWarrants: Having received an order, or if the terms of a suspended order are broken, the claimant can apply for a warrant of possession.\nPossessions: Once a warrant has been issued, county court bailiffs can repossess the property on behalf of the claimant.\nNote:\nPreviously, the figures presented in this dataset were claims that lead to orders, claims that lead to warrants, and claims that lead to repossessions. This counted the number of orders, warrants or repossessions that are unique to a claim, so that if one claim had two or more orders only the first was counted. In the current version of this dataset, they have been replaced with the total number of orders, warrants, and repossessions.\nSince Quarter 4 2014, regional data is longer available because it is no longer possible to calculate an accurate regional figure because the small numbers in local authority data are suppressed..

Summary: The data used in the MPS Business Crime dashboard is available here Business crime | Metropolitan Police, along with the related data definitions.\n\n\n\nPlease note that, this dataset is updated monthly at the beginning of the month. Data runs until the end of the month prior.\n\n***June 2024: The business crime data-sets are now being extracted and compiled from the new CONNECT system within the MPS; these data-sets will have prefix M1046 added to the file name.*** \n\nThe Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) has introduced CONNECT, a new crime recording system that consolidates several previous systems into one integrated platform. This change aims to streamline processes and enhance efficiency across the board.\n With the implementation of CONNECT, there have been slight modifications in the recording of specific crime categories, such as hate crime. These adjustments may result in minor variations in crime data when compared to the pre-CONNECT era. To provide a comprehensive view of the data, the MPS has regenerated the full report to cover the entire time period.\n\nBCU and Borough data in CONNECT are determined by the geographic location of the incident, rather than the borough managing the case, as was the case with legacy systems. This new approach has been retroactively applied to legacy data to provide consistent and comparable analysis.\n\nBusiness Crime is defined by the National Business Crime Forum (NBCF), the Home Office, and the National Retail Crime Steering Group (NRCSG), chaired by the minister for crime prevention as: \n\n\n  “Any criminal offence that is committed against a person or property which is associated by the connection of that person or property to a business.”  \n\n\n The approach reflects the existing definitions for domestic abuse and hate crime. This means that the victim will determine whether or not the crime has had an impact on a business and, therefore, whether it should be identified as a business crime. This removes any ambiguity about how the crime should be recorded. \n\n\n Not all business crime will be immediately identified as such by the victim or others. For example, an assault in a nightclub might not be identified as a business crime by the victim because they are more likely to perceive it as a personal attack, e.g. motivated by domestic abuse or hate related hostility. \n\n\n Irrespective of the nature of the offending, if the offence took place on business premises it should additionally be recorded as a business crime. This is because criminal offending of any type on business premises may have a negative impact on the business, e.g. increased insurance premiums or, as in the case of the nightclub assault, adverse impact on whether the nightclub’s license is renewed (e.g. too many assault have taken place at that venue). \n\n\n  Further details can be found on the National Business Crime Centre website here:  \n\n\nhttps://nbcc.police.uk/\n.

There is a difference in how Hate Crime and Domestic Abuse are recorded on CONNECT compared with the legacy crime recording system of CRIS and for this reason, Hate Crime and Domestic Abuse figures pre an post March are not comparable.\n\n\nBCU and Borough data in CONNECT are determined by the geographic location of the incident, rather than the borough managing the case, as was the case with legacy systems. This new approach has been retroactively applied to legacy data to provide consistent and comparable analysis.\nTotal Notifiable Offence (TNO) data follows the Home Office counting rules for recorded crime (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/counting-rules-for-recorded-crime ).   NB   This data-set includes “Other Accepted Crime”, which are non-notifiable crimes and must be excluded if calculating a TNO total.\n\nThe “Other Crime” offence data follows the Home Office counting rules but have been grouped by specific features (e.g. Knife Crime): please see dashboard for definitions.  NB \"Hate Crime\" totals do NOT include records that are flagged solely as 'domestic abuse'.\nMeasures include Offences, Positive Outcomes, and the Positive Outcome Rate (total number of positive outcomes divided by the total number of offences in a given period).\nAll data is broken down by financial year for each crime type..

Please note that, Datasets are updated monthly at the beginning of the month. Please note, this data runs until the end of the month prior.\nDefinitions / Counting Rules\nStop & Search - When an officer stops a member of the public and searches them. The police can only detain members of the public in order to carry out a search when certain conditions have been met. Search powers fall under different areas of legislation which include searching for: Stolen property; Prohibited articles namely offensive weapons or anything used for burglary, theft, deception or criminal damage; Drugs; Guns.\nMore Thorough Searches - As defined by the College of Policing, this is a search involving the removal of more than JOG (jacket, outer coat, gloves) that exposes intimate parts of the body. (Legislation: PACE - Code A, paragraph 3.7)\nStop & Search Positive Outcome - In the context of a Stop & Search, a 'positive outcome' is when the stop results in either a Caution, Community Resolution, Penalty Notice, Postal Charge\\Summons, or Arrest.\nPlease note that ‘Sex’ is recorded as ‘Male’, ‘Female’, ‘Unknown’ and ‘Vehicle Only’ (for vehicle-only searches). There is always a possibility that some MTIPS records will have a gender of ‘Unknown’ and ‘Vehicle Only’, usually as a result of a data recording error, however there are very few. For example, between 01/05/2020 – 19/05/2022, of the 9,168 records where an MTIP was recorded, only 8 records came back with the gender field stating ‘Unknown’ or ‘Vehicle Only’.\nCaveats\nThe MPS fully recognises the distress to the individual which any type of search where intimate parts are exposed can cause, and does not seek to downplay this. However, dip sampling of records has shown that historically some of the records included in this dashboard were wrongly recorded as MTIPs, when they were in fact strip searches conducted in custody after arrest. There will therefore be some double counting, as these will also have been recorded on our custody system and will be therefore be counted in both this dashboard and the separate strip search dashboard.\n\n\n\n\nDue to an internal IT deployment, from 27th February these datasets may be temporarily disrupted.

Please note that, this dataset is updated monthly at the beginning of the month. Data runs until the end of the month prior.\n \nDefinitions / Counting Rules\n\nStop and Search (S&S) - When an officer stops a member of the public and searches them. The police can only detain members of the public in order to carry out a search when certain conditions have been met. Search powers fall under different areas of legislation which include searching for\n\n- Stolen property\n- Prohibited articles namely offensive weapons or anything used for burglary, theft, deception or criminal damage\n- Drugs\n- Guns\n\nHistorically searches of unattended vehicles and vessels have made up a very low proportion of search activity.\nPACE and Other Stops and Searches - Stops and Searches under PACE (Police and Criminal Evidence Act), S23 Drugs Act, S47 Firearms Act plus a very small number not included in the other categories (e.g. s27(1) Aviation Security Act 1982 or S7 Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol) Act 1985)\nSection 60 Criminal Justice & Public Order Act 1994 (s.60) - Where an authorising officer reasonably believes that serious violence may take place or that persons are carrying dangerous instruments or offensive weapons without good reason they may authorise powers for officers in uniform to stop and search any person or vehicles within a defined area and time period.\nSearch Groupings - Searches within this report are sometimes grouped as either Weapons, ASB or Key Crime searches. The Weapons group is composed of stops recorded under codes C - Firearms (s47 Firearms Act), D - Offensive Weapons (s1 PACE), K - Anticipated Violence (s60 CJPO). The ASB group is composed of codes B - Drugs (s23 Misuse of Drugs Act), L- Criminal Damage (s1 Pace), Y- Psychoactive Substances, Z - Fireworks (s1 Pace). The Key Crime Group is composed of codes A - Stolen Property (s1 PACE), F- Going Equipped (s1 PACE).\nPositive Outcomes - A Positive Outcome is any outcome other than 'No Further Action (NFA)'The Positive Outcome rate is determined by dividing the number of positive outcomes by the total number of searches.\nEthnic Appearance - The ethnicity of the person stopped as perceived by the officer. For further information on the mapping of 4+1 groupings to 18+1 census data please see HO report Statistics on Race and the Criminal Justice System 2010 at http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pubsstatistical.html\n\nSelf Defined Ethnicity (SDE) - The ethnic group as defined by the person stopped (National Census categories).\nThis report uses 2011 Census data. This is held in 18+1 format and the recorded ethnic appearance of the Stop/Search (4+1) must be mapped to the appropriate 18+1 Census categories. The categories are mapped as follows:\n\nWhite = White British, White Irish, White Gypsy or Irish Traveller, and any other White Background.\nBlack = Black or Black British, Caribbean, African, Mixed White and Black Caribbean, Mixed White and Black African, and any other Black Background\nAsian = Asian or Asian British Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Chinese, Mixed White and Asian and any other Asian background.\nOther = Arab, and any other Ethnic Group\n \nCaveats\n\nThe Borough shown is location of search and not necessarily the borough of the officer conducting the search.\nThe ethnicity of persons stopped and searched within the central London area are unlikely to reflect the resident population due to large numbers of both British and foreign tourists in this region.\nThe MPS fully recognises the distress to the individual which any type of search where intimate parts are exposed can cause, and does not seek to downplay this. However, dip sampling of records has shown that historically some of the records included in this dashboard were wrongly recorded as MTIPs, when they were in fact strip searches conducted in custody after arrest. There will therefore be some double counting, as these will also have been recorded on our custody system and will be therefore be counted in both this dashboard and the separate strip search dashboard.\n\n \n\nNB Data uploaded to this area after February 2024 is sourced from the CONNECT system.

As part of this, the Mayor is driving forward an ambitious plan to make the city Net Zero-Carbon by 2030 and expects GLA funded training providers to have a Net Zero-Carbon plan in place by 2024.\nTo help providers meet this expectation, the Mayor launched a Net Zero- Carbon toolkit in November 2023, providing best practice and guidance. Building on this work, the GLA has commissioned a report, led by the Carbon Trust and Alliance for Sustainability Leadership in Education EAUC. This report estimates the potential cost and skills required for FE colleges to achieve Net Zero-Carbon by 2030. \nWhilst highlighting opportunities for the government to work more closely with the Mayor on this agenda, the report estimates that decarbonising London’s FE estates could cost between £213-279 million. .

Users should note that the London figures are provisional at this stage and may be subject to change before they are reported in the GLA’s Annual Monitoring Report in February 2011. Local authorities have until early September, five months after the end of the financial year, to complete the HFR form.\nThis change to the data collection process has enabled Communities and Local Government (DCLG) to publish the net supply of housing statistical release for 2009-10 four months earlier than in previous years.\nDCLG also publish house building statistics by local authority (Table 253), but the GLA prefer to use Net Additional Dwellings because they are more complete in terms of borough coverage, and comprehensive, as they cover more than just new build.\nDwellings estimate is at 31 March  Figures from 2001 and 2011 are census figures. All figures from 2002 to 2011 have been revised following the release of the dwelling count from the 2011 census.  Data from 2003, 2003 and 2004 contains a number of imputed and adjusted values and should not be considered as robust as subsequent years.\nAverage dwelling size (persons per dwelling) using population estimate (ONS) divided by number of dwellings.\nPopulation data is from ONS mid year estimates and projections.\nExternal links:\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/live-tables-on-net-supply-of-housing\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/live-tables-on-dwelling-stock-including-vacants.

The difference between the estimate and its true value is known as the sampling error. The actual sampling error for any estimate is unknown but we can estimate, from the sample, a typical error, known as the standard error. This provides a means of assessing the precision of the estimate; the lower the standard error, the more confident we can be the estimate is close to the true value. https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/articles/showArticle.asp?title=Information&article=news/071212_abi-stderrors.htm\nThis dataset excludes farm based agriculture data contained in SIC class 0100.\nRelevant link: https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/Default.asp.

For 2013/14 and 2011/12 the figures are average weekly income.\nThey are calculated using a model based method to produce the following four estimates of income using a combination of survey data from the Family Resources Survey, and previously published data from the 2011 Census and a number of administrative data sources. The four different measures of income are:\n\nTotal household income\nNet household income\nNet household income (equivalised) before housing costs\nNet household income (equivalised) after housing costs\n\nTotal annual household income is the sum of the gross income of every member of the household plus any income from benefits such as Working Families Tax Credit.\nNet annual household income is the sum of the net income of every member of the household. It is calculated using the same components as total income but income is net of:\n\nincome tax payments;\nnational insurance contributions;\ndomestic rates/council tax;\ncontributions to occupational pension schemes;\nall maintenance and child support payments, which are deducted from the income of the person making the payments; and\nparental contribution to students living away from home.\n\nNet annual household income before housing costs (equivalised) is composed of the same elements as net household weekly income but is subject to the OECD’s equivalisation scale.\nNet annual household income after housing costs (equivalised) is composed of the same elements of net household weekly income but is subject to the following deductions prior to the OECD’s equivalisation scale being applied:\n\nrent (gross of housing benefit);\nwater rates, community water charges and council water charges;\nmortgage interest payments (net of any tax relief);\nstructural insurance premiums (for owner occupiers); and\nground rent and service charges.\n\nFor detailed information on aspects of the quality and methodology behind these statistics, see the Technical Report.\n\nThis dataset is included in the Greater London Authority's Night Time Observatory.

Summary:  OpenStreetMap (openstreetmap.org) is a global collaborative mapping project, which offers maps and map data released with an open license, encouraging free re-use and re-distribution. The data is created by a large community of volunteers who use a variety of simple on-the-ground surveying techniques, and wiki-syle editing tools to collaborate as they create the maps, in a process which is open to everyone. The project originated in London, and an active community of mappers and developers are based here. Mapping work in London is ongoing (and you can help!) but the coverage is already good enough for many uses.\nBrowse the map of London on OpenStreetMap.org\nDownloads:\nThe whole of England updated daily:\n\nengland.osm.bz2 ~185M - .osm formatted raw XML data (compressed)\nengland.shp.zip ~156M - ESRI shapefiles\n\nFor more details of downloads available from OpenStreetMap, including downloading the whole planet, see 'planet.osm' on the wiki.\nData access APIs:\nDownload small areas of the map by bounding-box. For example this URL requests the data around Trafalgar Square: http://api.openstreetmap.org/api/0.6/map?bbox=-0.13062,51.5065,-0.12557,51.50969\nData filtered by \"tag\". For example this URL returns all elements in London tagged shop=supermarket: http://www.informationfreeway.org/api/0.6/*[shop=supermarket][bbox=-0.48,51.30,0.21,51.70]\nThe .osm format\nThe format of the data is a raw XML represention of all the elements making up the map. OpenStreetMap is composed of interconnected \"nodes\" and \"ways\" (and sometimes \"relations\") each with a set of name=value pairs called \"tags\". These classify and describe properties of the elements, and ultimately influence how they get drawn on the map. To understand more about tags, and different ways of working with this data format refer to the following pages on the OpenStreetMap wiki.\n\n.osm - About the raw XML data format of OpenStreetMap\nDownloading data - More details of the API and extract download options\nXapi - The extended api for filtering by tag\nMap Features - A list of tags, and what map features they represent\nConverting map data between formats - catalogue of tools for converting from .osm to other formats\n\nSimple embedded maps\nRather than working with raw map data, you may prefer to embed maps from OpenStreetMap on your website with a simple bit of javascript. You can also present overlays of other data, in a manner very similar to working with google maps. In fact you can even use the google maps API to do this. See OSM on your own website for details and links to various javascript map libraries.\nHelp build the map!\nThe OpenStreetMap project aims to attract large numbers of contributors who all chip in a little bit to help build the map. Although the map editing tools take a little while to learn, they are designed to be as simple as possible, so that everyone can get involved. This project offers an exciting means of allowing local London communities to take ownership of their part of the map.\nRead about how to Get Involved and see the London page for details of OpenStreetMap community events..

The project also implemented a range of technical and commercial solutions aiming to accelerate the transition to EVs for commercial fleet operators, while helping GB’s distribution networks plan and prepare for the mass adoption of EVs. The project aimed to reduce the impact of EVs on distribution networks and ensure security of electricity supply while saving money for electricity customers, helping the UK meet its clean air and climate change objectives.\n\n\nThe project consisted of three trial workstreams (WS):\n\n\n\nWS1, investigating the impact of commercial vehicles charging at homes\n\n\nWS2, monitoring and optimising commercial vehicles charging in depots\n\n\nWS3, which uses private hire vehicle (PHV) journey data to model the impact of these vehicles on the distribution network.\n\n\n\nThe trial period for WS3 began in August 2020, with WS1 and WS2 trials commencing on 1 July 2021. All trials concluded at the end of June 2022.\n\n\nOptimise Prime is sharing the project datasets by making them publicly available to the wider electricity, fleet and PHV industry to optimise their vehicle electrification plans. DNOs, academics and interested parties will be able to utilise this anonymised data created by the project for further research, analysis and forecasting. Along with the datasets, an introductory document is available below, it provides information on the content of those datasets, guidance on how to interpret each data field and instructions on how to access the data.\n\n\nOver the course of the trials, the project has collected and analysed data from a wide range of sources in order to carry out a wide range of experiments. The key datasets collected and used in analysis are available here.

Summary: Table shows the percentage of households that are defined as overcrowded - defined by the 'bedroom standard'.\n'Overcrowded includes Basic Overcrowded and Severely Overcrowded. This includes households with at least 1 bedroom too few.\n'Bedroom standard' is used as an indicator of occupation density. A standard number of bedrooms is allocated to each household in accordance with its age/sex/marital status composition and the relationship of the members to one another. A separate bedroom is allocated to each married or cohabiting couple, any other person aged 21 or over, each pair of adolescents aged 10 - 20 of the same sex, and each pair of children under 10. Any unpaired person aged 10 - 20 is paired, if possible with a child under 10 of the same sex, or, if that is not possible, he or she is given a separate bedroom, as is any unpaired child under 10. This standard is then compared with the actual number of bedrooms (including bed-sitters) available for the sole use of the household, and differences are tabulated. Bedrooms converted to other uses are not counted as available unless they have been denoted as bedrooms by the informants; bedrooms not actually in use are counted unless uninhabitable.\nPlease note, unfortunately the Department for Communities and Local Government, who sponsored a question relating to the number of bedrooms in a household no longer take part in the Integrated Household Survey, and therefore the question will not be included again.

However, patient counts should not be interpreted as a direct proxy for population. Patient counts have been prone to compounding inflation in recent years, primarily as a result of failures to remove former patients that have since moved overseas (local inflation/deficits also occur due to delays in patients updating their records or registering with a new GP when moving within the UK).\nThe rate of inflation varies by area, sex, and age, being greatest for:\n\nareas with high volumes of international migration\nadults age 20-30 (with the impact spreading to older groups over time)\nmales - due to typically lower levels of interaction with health services\n.

Summary: Introduction\nThis note summarises trends in pay in London and the UK since 2010 and compares them to inflation trends. The focus is on median gross weekly earnings for all employees (full- and part-time) working in London. The counterfactual analysis is based on annual pay estimates. \nNotes on the data\n\nThe employee pay estimates in this note do not cover self-employed jobs and come from a survey of UK businesses. There are, moreover, several discontinuities in the ONS ASHE series (e.g. in 2004, 2006, 2011 and 2021). The growth rates calculated over these periods are illustrative, not precise figures.\nDuring the pandemic earnings estimates were affected by compositional changes and the furlough scheme, making interpretation more difficult. Data collection disruption and lower response rates also mean that estimates for 2020 and 2021 are subject to greater uncertainty.\nReal earnings (earnings adjusted for inflation) have been calculated by adjusting nominal (unadjusted) earnings using the Consumer Prices Index including owner occupiers’ housing costs (CPIH). The CPIH is the most comprehensive measure of inflation in the UK.\n. Published by GLA Economics. Tags: employment, labour market, earnings. Temporal Coverage: None - None.

Its purposes are:\n\n\nTo lift the poorest pensioners out of poverty by providing a contribution to a minimum guaranteed income for those aged 60 and over living in Great Britain.\n\n\nTo reward those aged 65 and over who have made modest provision for their retirement.\n\n\nIt is not necessary to have paid National Insurance contributions to be eligible. Pension Credit replaced the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG), which, itself, replaced Income Support for older people in April 1999. However, the principle of a guaranteed minimum income continues to apply.\nThere are two parts to Pension Credit: the guarantee credit and the savings credit. The guarantee credit provides financial help for people aged 60 or over whose income is below a certain level set by the law. The level that applies depends on personal circumstances; this is the standard minimum guarantee. The awarded amount will depend on other sources of income, such as other pensions and savings. Extra amounts will be added to the standard minimum guarantee for those who have: relevant housing costs severe disabilities caring responsibilities\nThe savings credit is an extra amount for people aged 65 or over who have made some provision for their retirement (such as savings or a second pension) which brings their income above a level set by Parliament, called the ‘savings credit threshold’. The aim is to reward pensioners who have modest income or savings. A savings credit can be given on top of a guarantee credit. Claimants may still get a savings credit even if their income is above the standard minimum guarantee level.\nDWP data downloaded from NOMIS website.

A survey was conducted through City Hall’s online research community Talk London. An option was provided for respondents to fill out the survey without registering an account on Talk London (48 respondents chose this option).\nA further survey with identical questions and sample of 500 Londoners from black and ethnic minority backgrounds was commissioned through research agency TNS, in order to ensure that this group’s responses were well represented.\nResults from both surveys were combined and incorporated into the draft plan, ahead of a further consultation in Winter 2016. You can view the separate datasets or combined crosstabs below.\n\nCombined Talk London and TNS Survey Crosstabs – approximately 8,000 responses.\nTalk London Police and Crime Plan Survey Crosstabs – approximately 7,400 responses.

One of the proposals is to close 65 front counters, where the public can access the police in person.\nThis page contains links to two main outputs: 1. Travel times for each LSOA in London to front counters 2. Geocoded file of front counter locations Maps visualising the travel times before and after the proposed closures are available here.\nTravel Times\nThis dataset was commissioned to help Londoners see whether they would still be able to travel to a front counter using public transport in 45 minutes or less. LSOAs are a convenient way of splitting London up as they have roughly equal populations and the ONS uses them to aggregate all Census statistics leading to good interoperability. The timings were produced by WSYL Ltd (locatable.com) acting on behalf of Jenny Jones AM (as of Feb 2013).\nThe method of obtaining the data was a mixture of proprietary technology made by Locatable and the use of Transport for London's data feeds (http://www.tfl.gov.uk/businessandpartners/syndication/default.aspx) for accurate public transport times. For every LSOA centre-point, the distance to the nearest open 24 hour and daytime police station was gauged. If either was more than a mile away (in a straight line), the TfL data was consulted for an accurate journey time. A walking pace of 2.5mph was assumed, which is conservative for a healthy adult. If the closest counter is proposed for closure, the next qualifying counter was found and the time to that location from the centre of the LSOA in question was determined.\nThe final dataset contains 1 line per LSOA, which includes the travel times to the nearest open police counter at:\n0400 on 03/03/13 with current status of police counters\n1200 on 03/03/13 with current status of police counters\n0400 on 03/03/13 with proposed status of police counters\n1200 on 03/03/13 with proposed status of police counters\nFront Counter Locations\nThese files were produced by WSYL Ltd (locatable.com) acting on behalf of Jenny Jones AM (as of Feb 2013). In the CSV file, each line describes one police front counter as it currently stands (in Feb 2013) and after the proposed reducton in service (some time after Match 2013, if approved). A counter may be open 24/7, during the daytime or \"voluneteer\" or \"temporary\". For most purposes volunteer, temporary and daytime are the same.\nThe geocoded counter locations were derived from the postcode of each counter's address, using the Ordnance Survey Open Code Point dataset (http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/products/code-point-open/). This is available under the terms of the OS Open Data License (https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/docs/licences/os-opendata-licence.pdf).

The residence qualification requires a person to be normally living at the address on the qualifying date, even if temporarily absent. People having more than one place of residence, such as students, may therefore be included on more than one register.\nIn Northern Ireland, eligibility for registration requires three month's residence within the province. Overseas electors are not resident in the United Kingdom, but must previously have been resident here and included in the electoral register (unless they were too young to register). They are registered in the same parliamentary constituency as before they went abroad.

Research for this dataset has been assisted by The Guardian Cities team.\nData sources\nBoundaries and attributes are based on GiGL’s Open Space dataset, which is a collated dataset of spatial and attribute information from various sources, including: habitat and open space survey information provided to GiGL by the GLA and London boroughs, borough open space survey information where provided to GiGL or available under open licence, other attribute information inferred from field visits or research. Available open space information has been analysed by GiGL to identify POPS included in this dataset. Future updates to the GiGL Open Space dataset will inform future, improved releases of the POPS dataset.\nDefinition\nFor the purposes of creating the dataset, POPS have been carefully defined as below. The definition is based on review of similar definitions internationally and appropriateness for application to available London data.\nPrivately Owned Public Spaces (POPS): publicly accessible spaces which are provided and maintained by private developers, offices or residential building owners. They include city squares, atriums and small parks. The spaces provide several functional amenities for the public. They are free to enter and may be open 24 hours or have restricted access arrangements. Whilst the spaces look public, there are often constraints to use.\nFor the Greater London dataset no consideration is taken as to a site’s formal status in planning considerations, and only unenclosed POPS are included.\nPOPS may be destination spaces, which attract visitors from outside of the space’s immediate area and are designed for use by a broad audience, or neighbourhood spaces, which draw residents and employees from the immediate locale and are usually strongly linked with the adjacent street or host building. These spaces are of high quality and include a range of amenities. The POPS may also be a hiatus space, accommodating the passing user for a brief stop only – for example it may include seating but few other amenities, a circulation space, designed to improve a pedestrian’s journey from A to B, or a marginal space, which whilst a public space is not very accommodating and experiences low levels of usage.

Kayden, The New York City Department of City Planning, and the Municipal Art Society of New York, published by John Wiley & Sons, 2000).\nNOTE: The boundaries are based on Ordnance Survey mapping and the data is published under Ordnance Survey's 'presumption to publish'.Contains OS data © Crown copyright and database rights 2017..

Summary: \nThese small area model-based estimates of subjective loneliness have been produced by Age UK, for people aged 65 and over at Borough level and middle and lower super output areas (MSOA/LSOA) in London.\nThey are calculated using a model based method using a combination of data from the English Longitudinal Survey of Ageing (ELSA) from 2010-12 and small area Census data from 2011. Further details of the methodology can be found at Age UK.\nThe different measures included in the data are\n1.      The ‘log odds’ of the risk of loneliness among older people\n2.      The estimated prevalence of loneliness among older people\n3.      The area ranking for London of the relative risk of loneliness among older people\n4.      The area ranking for England of the relative risk of loneliness among older people\n Background notes: 1. Prevalence estimates: these estimates of prevalence are based on characteristics significantly associated with loneliness which could be estimated at small area level from 2011 Census data. Not all characteristics could be measured from the Census and so these estimates underestimate the true level of loneliness based on national survey and regular polling data. They are designed to be used to examine variation between areas rather than as a true estimate of the prevalence of loneliness in a given area\n2. LSOA: Care needs to be taken when using estimates based on LSOA estimates due to other potential confounding factors such as communal establishment within the area such as care homes, hospitals, hospices etc. The risk factors were based on a survey of domestic rather than communal establishments only\n3. The main aim of the modelling was to produce small area estimates which are not available for other sources. Borough level estimates are included for context, but alternative estimates at this level may give a more accurate assessment of prevalence\n\nA map of the MSOA data can be viewed on the Datastore.Source: Office for National Statistics.

Summary: This CSV table shows a breakdown of the dwelling stock down to a lower geographic level Lower layer Super Output Area or LSOA, categorised by the property build period and property type. CSV metadata.\nCounts in the tables are rounded to the nearest 10 with those below 5 recorded as negligible and appearing as -. Data on build period, or age of property, has been used to create 12 property build period categories: Pre-1900, 1900-1918, 1919-1929, 1930-1939, 1945-1954, 1955-1964, 1965-1972, 1973-1982, 1983-1992, 1993-1999, 2000-2009, and 2010-2015.\nData on property type includes breakdown by bungalow, terraced, flat/maisonette, semi-detached and detached, and by the number of bedrooms. The counts are calculated from domestic property data for England and Wales extracted from the Valuation Office Agencys administrative database on 31 March 2015, and on 1 August 2012 and 31 March 2014. The VOA have published data that shows homes by period built, or type, and council tax band down to MSOA and LSOA level.\nRounding: Small differences between the rounding conventions are applied to the 2014 and 2015 statistics. For 2014 The rounding convention applied to the tables: Counts are rounded to the nearest 10 dwellings and counts less than 5 are reported as negligible (-). For 2015 The rounding convention applied to the tables: Counts are rounded to the nearest 10 with counts of zero being reported as \"0\" and counts fewer than 5 reported as negligible and denoted by \"-\".\nNational Statistics Postcode Lookup file (NSPL): Different NSPL files have been used for 2014 and 2015 statistics (February 2014 NSLP used February 2015 NSLP used). As a results, postcodes can be moved in different OAs. Further information on NSPL can be found at ONS\nProperty attributes: As part of the day to day VOA work, attributes information can be added (where no information is recorded) and/or changed (existing information is updated). This would result in counts in categories changing.\nNew entries and deletions: New entries into the CT List together with deletions from the CT List will result in changes to counts. New entries could be as a result from splits, mergers, new build but also entries which were not previously in the CT List i.e. a shop is converted in a domestic property. Similarly, deletions could be as a result from splits, mergers, demolitions but also entries no longer domestic properties i.e. a house is converted into a shop (non-domestic property).

Summary: Transport for London's (TFL) Public Transport Accessibility Levels (PTALs)\nPTALS are a detailed and accurate measure of the accessibility of a point to the public transport network, taking into account walk access time and service availability. The method is essentially a way of measuring the density of the public transport network at any location within Greater London.\nEach area is graded between 0 and 6b, where a score of 0 is very poor access to public transport, and 6b is excellent access to public transport.\nThe current methodology was developed in 1992, by the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham. The model has been thoroughly reviewed and tested, and has been agreed by the London Borough-led PTAL development group as the most appropriate for use across London.\nThe measure therefore reflects:\n\nWalking time from the point-of interest to the public transport access points;\nThe reliability of the service modes available;\nThe number of services available within the catchment; and\nThe level of service at the public transport access points - i.e. average waiting time.\n\nIt does not consider:\n\nThe speed or utility of accessible services;\nCrowding, including the ability to board services; or,\nEase of interchange.\n\nThe PTAL methodology was developed for London where a dense integrated public transport network means that nearly all destinations can be reached within a reasonable amount of time. Research using the ATOS (Access to Opportunities and Services) methodology shows that there is a strong correlation between PTALs and the time taken to reach key services – i.e. high PTAL areas generally have good access to services and low PTAL areas have poor access to services.\nNotes\n6-digit references identify 100m grid squares.\nThe 2015 files are available to download below. This includes the GIS contour files.\nCurrent PTAL values can be viewed on TfL’s web site.\nWe also invite you to visit WebCAT: TfL’s Web-based Connectivity Assessment Toolkit. Through an interactive mapping interface users can view for any location in London, PTAL values as well as travel time plots. Associated with the travel time plots users can also select bar charts showing catchment statistics (for example, population, jobs or services) using the same travel time bands as displayed on the map.

Auditing all acute London hospital sites against the agreed and commissioned acute medicine and emergency general surgery standards; and \n\n2. Driving the development and commissioning of London quality standards for further services not covered by the previous review. These were: \n\n Critical care; \n\n Emergency departments; \n\n Fractured neck of femur; \n\n Maternity services; and \n\n Paediatric emergency services.\n\nThe audit process was developed by clinical expert and patient panels and quality assured by an independent academic review. Following two pilot audits, the full audit was undertaken between May 2012 and January 2013 to ascertain the status of London hospitals against the achievement of the acute medicine and emergency general surgery London quality standards.\n\nClick here to visit the myhealthlondon website. \n.

Summary: This table shows the average House Price/Earnings ratio, which is an important indicator of housing affordability. Ratios are calculated by dividing house price by the median earnings of a borough.\nThe Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) is based on a 1 per cent sample of employee jobs. Information on earnings and hours is obtained in confidence from employers. It does not cover the self-employed nor does it cover employees not paid during the reference period. Information is as at April each year. The statistics used are workplace based full-time individual earnings.\nPre-2013 Land Registry housing data are for the first half of the year only, so that they are comparable to the ASHE data which are as at April. This is no longer the case from 2013 onwards as this data uses house price data from the ONS House Price Statistics for Small Areas statistical release. Prior to 2006 data are not available for Inner and Outer London.\nThe lowest 25 per cent of prices are below the lower quartile; the highest 75 per cent are above the lower quartile. The \"lower quartile\" property price/income is determined by ranking all property prices/incomes in ascending order. The 'median' property price/income is determined by ranking all property prices/incomes in ascending order. The point at which one half of the values are above and one half are below is the median.\nRegional data has not been published by DCLG since 2012. Data for regions has been calculated by the GLA.

Summary: \nThe GLA commissioned the Social Market Foundation to look at the reasons behind the non-continuation (drop-out) rate of undergraduates studying at London’s higher education institutions.\n\nThis report seeks to understand the factors affecting non-continuation and transfers at London universities. London’s non-continuation rate is 7.7%, which is much higher than the English average of 6.3%, and students in London are the most likely to transfer to another university compared to students in the rest of the country. We seek to build on previous SMF work by focusing on why students leave university in London and the report looks in-depth at the differences in retention by ethnicity and socio-economic status. This report draws on qualitative and quantitative evidence.

The purpose of the review was to identify the gap in post-16 SEND provision in London and produce a sustainable methodology for projecting demand that could inform future planning cycles. The project team included SEND specialists and was supported by a steering group that included a range of experienced stakeholders from across London. \nThe project consisted of five parts; a demand model that projected the number of 16 to 25 year olds with EHCPs with different levels of learning support, an analysis of current supply, a gap analysis, an EHCP review, and stakeholder interviews. Key findings from the analysis were used to derive recommendations for the SEND sector in London. The review took place between January and July 2018.. Published by .

Summary: \nIntroduction\n\n\nThe GiGL Spaces to Visit dataset provides locations and boundaries for open space sites in Greater London that are available to the public as destinations for leisure, activities and community engagement. It includes green corridors that provide opportunities for walking and cycling.\n\n\nThe dataset has been created by Greenspace Information for Greater London CIC (GiGL). As London’s Environmental Records Centre, GiGL mobilises, curates and shares data that underpin our knowledge of London’s natural environment. We provide impartial evidence to support informed discussion and decision making in policy and practice. \n\n\nGiGL maps under licence from the Greater London Authority. \n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThis dataset is a sub-set of the   GiGL Open Space dataset, the most comprehensive dataset available of open spaces in London. Sites are selected for inclusion in Spaces to Visit based on their public accessibility and likelihood that people would be interested in visiting.\nThe dataset is a mapped Geographic Information System (GIS) polygon dataset where one polygon (or multi-polygon) represents one space. As well as site boundaries, the dataset includes information about a site’s name, size and type (e.g. park, playing field etc.).\nGiGL developed the Spaces to Visit dataset to support anyone who is interested in London’s open spaces - including community groups, web and app developers, policy makers and researchers - with an open licence data source. More detailed and extensive data are available under GiGL data use licences for GIGL partners, researchers and students. Information services are also available for ecological consultants, biological recorders and community volunteers – please see www.gigl.org.uk for more information.\nPlease note that access and opening times are subject to change (particularly at the current time) so if you are planning to visit a site check on the local authority or site website that it is open.\nThe dataset is updated on a quarterly basis. If you have questions about this dataset please contact GiGL’s GIS and Data Officer.\n\nData sources\n\n\nThe boundaries and information in this dataset, are a combination of data collected during the London Survey Method habitat and open space survey programme (1986 – 2008) and information provided to GiGL from other sources since. These sources include London borough surveys, land use datasets, volunteer surveys, feedback from the public, park friends’ groups, and updates made as part of GiGL’s on-going data validation and verification process. \n\n\nDue to data availability, some areas are more up-to-date than others. We are continually working on updating and improving this dataset. If you have any additional information or corrections for sites included in the Spaces to Visit dataset please contact  GiGL’s GIS and Data Officer.\nNOTE: The dataset contains OS data © Crown copyright and database rights 2024.

        "embedding_text": "Title: Survey of Londoners 2021-22. Summary: In 2018-19 the GLA first undertook a Survey of Londoners. At the time it provided vital evidence on Londoners that had never been collected before in such detail. \nIn 2021-22, the GLA conducted another Survey of Londoners, following the same methodology as the Survey of Londoners 2018-19, an online and paper self-completion survey of adults aged 16 and over in London.\nThe survey, which received responses from 8,630 Londoners, aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 and associated restrictions on key social outcomes for Londoners, not available from other data sources. \nIt is important to understand the context in which the Survey of Londoners 2021-22 took place. Survey fieldwork began in November 2021; so, up to that point, it had been four months since most legal limits on social contact had been removed. However, after fieldwork had started, some restrictions due to the emergence of the Omicron variant were introduced. This may or may not have had some effect on the data. Given these changing circumstances, caution should be applied when interpreting the results.\nThe Survey of Londoners 2021-22 also took place just before the full effects of the cost-of-living crisis began to set in. It is highly likely that the situations of Londoners have changed while analysis was taking place.\nOn this page there is a headline findings report, published on 30 September 2022, which provides descriptive results for the key headline measures and supporting demographic data collected by the survey. Accompanying this report are more detailed tables documenting the key results of the survey by a range of demographic and other characteristics, a short summary document presenting key findings from the survey, and a technical report for those interested in the survey’s methodology. Further to these, a series of pen portraits, providing snapshots of particular groups of Londoners, as captured at the time of the Survey of Londoners 2021-22, were first added on 31 October 2022. \nAlso on this page, there is an initial findings report, that was published on 2 September 2022. This was published to provide timely evidence from the survey to support the case for further targeted support to help low-income Londoners with the cost-of-living crisis.\nWe have launched an online explorer where users can interrogate the data collected from the two surveys, conducted in 2018-19 and 2021-22. This is the first iteration, so we welcome any feedback on it - \nGO TO THE EXPLORER \n\nThe record-level Survey of Londoners dataset can be accessed via the UK Data Service, University of Essex. The dataset is available for not-for-profit educational and research purposes only.\nFinally, as the North East London (NEL) NHS funded a 'boost' in their sub-region to enable a more detailed analysis to be conducted within, they produced an analytical report in September 2022.

Summary: The Mayor of London has placed a high priority on improving social integration, equality, diversity and inclusion, economic fairness and food security across the city.\nRecognising the need for better evidence in these areas to ensure that policy and programmes have maximum impact, the GLA conducted the Survey of Londoners in 2018-19, an online and paper self-completion survey of adults aged 16 and over in London.\nThe Survey, which received responses from 6,601 Londoners, aims to fill evidence gaps and help improve analysis and policy making in these areas. It uses questions that allow for comparison with existing London and national data, and has a larger sample size than regular opinion polling. This offers a more accurate picture of society in London and allows for detailed and robust analysis of sub-groups within London’s population.\nThis initial report provides descriptive results for the key headline measures and supporting demographic data collected by the Survey.

Summary: Child Tax Credit (CTC) provides support to families for the children (up to the 31 August after their 16th birthdays) and the \"qualifying\" young people (those in full-time non-advanced education until their 20th birthdays) for which they are responsible. It is paid in addition to Child Benefit. Some out of work families with children do not receive CTC but instead receive the equivalent amount via child and related allowances in Income Support or income-based Jobseeker's Allowance (IS/JSA). These families are included in the figures, generally together with out of work families receiving CTC. In due course, they will be \"migrated\" to tax credits. Working Tax Credit (WTC) tops up the earnings of families on low or moderate incomes.\nPeople working for at least 16 hours a week can claim it if they (a) are responsible for at least one child or qualifying young person, (b) have a disability which puts them at a disadvantage in getting a job or (c) in the first year of work, having returned to work aged at least 50 after a period of at least six months receiving out-of-work benefits.

Under 16 rates are per 1000 female population aged 13-15. Counts for City of London have been combined with those for Hackney For conceptions leading to abortions, rates based on fewer than 10 events have been suppressed. Occasionally it has been necessary to apply a secondary suppression to avoid the possibility of disclosure by differencing.\nMiscarriages and illegal abortions are not included in the conception rates, resulting in rates that may be an under estimation..

Crime figures for the LU, DLR, London Tramlink and LO have been provided by the BTP. Crime figures for LU and DLR are reported together as these networks are policed by the same division of the BTP. The BTP only deals with crime relating to the rail and Tramlink network\nThe MPS is responsible for policing the rest of London’s transport network, including the bus network. The figures reported for the bus network are based on official MPS figures for bus-related crime unless otherwise stated.\nThere is no distinct category of ’bus crime’ in the MPS crime recording system. Recorded crime data is extracted from the MPS system using a complex query that searches all MPS crime for transport venue codes and those that have the word bus, bus stop, bus station and transport related words somewhere in the electronic case file. For this reason, some crimes that did not occur on the bus network will be included in the figures. This is different from the BTP as all crimes dealt with by the BTP and included on their crime recording system relate directly to the rail network.\nThe crime volume and rate figures displayed by month are accurate according to the month they were extracted from police and TfL systems and are subject to revision due to late reporting of crimes and adjustment of crime and passenger figures. The full financial year total of figures will differ slightly as they will reflect the most accurate and up to date crime and passenger data available; hence the monthly figures here should not be used to generate full financial year totals. The adjusted financial year figures are published in the annual TfL Crime Statistics Bulletin available here.\nData will be updated on a quarterly basis, showing monthly breakdowns of crime volume and rate of crime per million passenger journeys. The rate of crime per million passenger journeys is calculated by the dividing the volume of crimes by the number of passenger journeys multiplied by one million.\nA crime rate per million passenger journeys was unavailable for London Overground prior to April 2011 due to lack of accurate passenger journey information across the entire London Overground network.\n\nThis dataset is included in the Greater London Authority's Night Time Observatory.

Summary: This is a new tool to help decision-makers choose which locations within London might be prioritised for tree planting. This tool presents the Curio Canopy – London Tree Canopy Cover map at ward scale[1], alongside several other environmental and social datasets.\nThere are multiple factors that influence both the existing variation in tree canopy cover across the capital, and the potential for increasing canopy cover, including population density, land use, differences in natural vegetation and existing habitats, soil type and topography. This tool is not a prescriptive guide to where canopy cover should be increased. It is designed as a tool to help decision-makers including local authorities, NGOs and funders, as well as Londoners, to identify where canopy cover is low, and where further consideration might be given to increasing canopy cover, based on a suite of different factors.\n\n[1] Wards correct as of March 2019.

This initiative aimed to bolster the capabilities of adult education providers, ensuring not only the continuation of skills development among Londoners but also addressing the challenge of digital exclusion.\n To gain a better understanding of the post-pandemic landscape, the Greater London Authority (GLA) commissioned Learning and Work Institute (L&W) to carry out mixed-methods research into the experience of learners in adult education and the quality of adult education provision in London.\nThis report provides an understanding of the impact of the increased use of remote learning following shift to online delivery during the pandemic.

As such data prior to April 2017 is not comparable.\n\n\n  \n\nCounting Rules \n\n\n\n\n\nEach row set represents use of force by an officer on one subject.  This row set is not a count of incident . Where more than one officer has used force on the same subject, this will be shown on separate rows of data. As such this will result in duplicate metadata. Further consideration needs to be taken when analysing this data to ensure correct conclusions are drawn. For example if 2 officers use force on an individual who happens to be male aged 18-34 this will be shown on 2 rows of data. Hence, if grouping the data, you would have a count of 2x males and 2x 18-34 which would be incorrect. \n\n\nIf the same Non CED Taser tactic is used more than once in an incident it is only counted once. \n\n\nWhere the tactic of use was CED Taser, only the use of highest severity is counted.

This is a useful tool for displaying a large amount of data for numerous geographies, in one place.\nThe Ward Atlas presents a more detailed version of the data including trend data and generally includes the raw numbers as opposed to percentages or rates.\nThe Instant Atlas reports use HTML5 technology, which can be used in modern browsers, including on Apple machines, but will not function on older browsers.\n\nWARD ATLAS FOR 2014 BOUNDARIES\n\nIn May 2014, ward boundaries changed in Hackney, Kensington and Chelsea, and Tower Hamlets. This version of the ward atlas gives data for these new wards, as well as retaining data on the unchanged wards in the rest of London for comparison purposes. Data for boroughs has also been included.\nVery few datasets have been published for the new ward boundaries, so the majority of data contained in this atlas have been modelled using a method of proportion of households from the old boundaries that are located in the new boundaries. Therefore, the data contained in this atlas are indicative only.\n\nInstant Atlas for 2014 Ward Atlas \n\n \nTips:\n\n- Select a new indicator from the Data box on the left. Select the theme, then indicator and then year to show the data.\n- To view data just for one borough*, use the filter tool.\n- Some legend settings can be altered by clicking on the cog icon next to the Wards tick box within the map legend.\n- The wards can be ranked in order by clicking at the top of the indicator column of the data table.\n\nNote: Additional indicator information and sources are included within the spreadsheet and Instant Atlas report.\nOTHER SMALL AREA PROFILES\nOther profiles available include Borough, LSOA and MSOA atlases.\nData from these profiles were used to create the Well-being scores tool.\n\n*The London boroughs are: City of London, Barking and Dagenham, Barnet, Bexley, Brent, Bromley, Camden, Croydon, Ealing, Enfield, Greenwich, Hackney, Hammersmith and Fulham, Haringey, Harrow, Havering, Hillingdon, Hounslow, Islington, Kensington and Chelsea, Kingston upon Thames, Lambeth, Lewisham, Merton, Newham, Redbridge, Richmond upon Thames, Southwark, Sutton, Tower Hamlets, Waltham Forest, Wandsworth, Westminster.\n\nThese profiles were created using the most up to date information available at the time of collection (September 2015)..

        "embedding_text": "Title: Waste Contracts Register. Summary: The Mayor set out his strategic policy framework for the management of London's municipal waste in the London Environment Strategy (LES), published in May 2018. Proposal 7.2.1.b set out the Mayor’s proposal to hold a contract register to monitor when waste authority contracts come up for renewal. The register is designed to be available for all waste authorities to view and support joint working and joint procurement opportunities. Joint working can provide better value for money on ‘like for like’ services and achieve service harmonisation across borough boundaries to help remove barriers to recycling.\nThe Greater London Authority (GLA) consulted waste authorities on the appropriate contracts to feature in the contract register, resulting in the creation of two documents that together form the contract register. The first document (Contract Expiry Dates) contains a table of the expiry dates for local authority waste and recycling collection contracts and another table of the expiry dates for local authority waste and recycling disposal contracts. The second document (Waste Contract Procurement) contains details of the waste and recycling contracts authorities have procured, or are currently procuring, since the Mayor published his LES in May 2018. London local authorities introducing new waste contracts or work are required to notify the Mayor and enter a consultation period in which the GLA determine general conformity of the contract documents with the Mayor’s LES. Publishing a list of the authorities undertaking this process to procure waste and recycling contracts gives other authorities the chance to identify opportunities for joint procurement.\nWaste authorities under the GLA Act 1999 are required to notify the Mayor in writing of their intention to commence an Find-A-Tender public procurement regulations (PPR) procedure:\n\nAllowing at least 56 days to elapse after giving notice before issuing a prior information notice in Find-A-Tender\nIf publishing a contract notice or cessation notice, allowing at least 108 days to elapse after notification before sending a contract notice to Find-A-Tender\n\nWaste authorities with Direct Service Order (DSO) or ‘in-house’ arrangements do not constitute a formal contract and are not bound by European public procurement procedures, so are under a duty to comply with the Mayor’s LES on an on-going basis, even when the LES changes.\nIf a waste authority is exempt from the PPRs, then the authority is barred from awarding the contract or work unless and until:\n\nit has notified the Mayor that it proposes to enter into such a contract and\nat least 56 days beginning on the date of notification has elapsed\n\nWaste authorities should publicly notify their intention to tender a waste contract to other waste authorities and Resource London at the same time as notifying the Mayor. When a waste authority notifies the GLA of their intention to introduce new work or procure a new contract, the GLA will update the contracts register for other waste authorities to view. When considering approaches to waste contract procurement, waste authorities are encouraged to first consult the contract register and explore joint procurement opportunities. Waste authorities are not required to inform the Mayor that they intend to extend an existing waste contract, but they are encouraged to engage with GLA officers before making the decision.\nYou can notify the Mayor in writing of your intention to procure a new waste contract by contacting Sam Davies at sam.davies@london.gov.uk. The GLA welcome positive and timely engagement from waste authorities to allow for a smooth and effective review process. Please get in touch for advice on the review procedure and support available.\nFor more information on the Mayor’s strategic direction for the management of London's waste, please refer to the Mayor’s London Environment Strategy.\nFor more information on the duties of London waste authorities to notify the Mayor of their intention to procure new waste contracts or award new work, please refer to the GLA Act. .

It also sought to assess how the topics and sentiment contained in Tweets differed by demographic and by London Borough.\nThe research also aimed to identify a methodology that could be repeated at different points in the future to collect comparable data, so that changes in sentiment or topic frequency could be tracked over time.\nTwitter was found to be a rich source of information relating to social integration in London. It provided anecdotal insight into the impact of social integration; both positive and negative.

The evidence reviews and stakeholder consultations were undertaken to explore the wider impacts of the pandemic on Londoners and the considerations for recovery within the context of improving population health outcomes.\nThe information presented in the wider impact slides represents the emerging evidence available at the time of conducting the work (May-August 2020).

A short report and examples of good practice are provided here.\nThese reports are intended as a resource to support stakeholders in planning during the transition and recovery phase.

The difference between the estimate and its true value is known as the sampling error. The actual sampling error for any estimate is unknown but we can estimate, from the sample, a typical error, known as the standard error. This provides a means of assessing the precision of the estimate; the lower the standard error, the more confident we can be the estimate is close to the true value.
