            "summary": "The data used in the MPS Custody (Arrests, Disposals, Strip Searches) dashboard is available here Custody Dashboard | Tableau Public, along with the related data definitions. Please note that, this data set runs a month behind with monthly updates.\n\n Arrests \n\nDate criteria is based on Date of Arrest as first recorded on the Custody Record.\nA Custody Record is created when a person reaches a Custody Suite. Data contained only relates to Custody Records created in the Metropolitan Police Service Custody Suites.\nThe volumes show a Count of Custody Records and not a count of individual people. A person may have been arrested/ detained more than once in the periods being viewed.\nThe Officer Defined Ethnicity is recorded on the Custody Record and then grouped as shown for reporting purposes. At the request of the Mayors’ Office for Policing and Crime (MOPAC), the Detainee’s Self Defined Ethnicity is not used in this report.\nChild is defined as a detainee who is at least 10 years of age at the time of Arrest, and under the age of 18 at the time of Arrest.\nThe “First Arrest Offence” is the first reason for arrest given to the Custody Staff by the Arresting Officer and is usually the most serious matter. These have been grouped into broad terms for the purpose of reporting. It must be understood that the Detainee may be dealt with for more than once offence whist in Detention.\nThe demographic breakdown for the Custody Population may not be directly comparable to that of London. The arrested person may be from anywhere in the UK or abroad.\nAlso, due to Central Cell Allocation, even on a local level, a person arrested may not go to a Custody Suite local to the area they live or the area in which they were arrested.\n \n\n Disposal \n\nDate criteria is based on Date of Arrest as first recorded on the Custody Record.\nThe volumes shown are based on a Count of Offences recorded on Custody Records.\nEach Custody Record may have more than one offence recorded on it.\nEach Offence is subject to its own Disposal.\nEach Offence may be given different Disposals at different times. The current (latest) disposal is shown. This may not be the last/ final Disposal.\nA Custody Record may have more than one similar offence recorded on it. Therefore, one Custody Record may have multiple similar offences each with its own/ different disposal.\nDisposal Decisions are based on numerous factors. These may include (but not limited to)\n-        Available evidence\n-        Any admissions\n-        Previous offending history\n-        Willingness of victims/ witnesses to substantiate allegations, make statements etc.\n-        Public arrest criteria\n \n\n Strip Search \n\nDate criteria is based on Date of Arrest as first recorded on the Custody Record.\nThe volumes shown are based on whether Strip Search was recorded as being undertaken at any point during the Detainee’s Detention.\nThe primary reason for a Strip Search being authorised/ conducted in a Custody Suite is to ensure the safety of the Detainee and the people around them. Factors effecting this consideration may be in relation to (but not limited to):\n-        The nature of the offence(s) arrested for (hidden weapons or drugs)\n-        Warning markers on the PNC (Police National Computer)\n-        Concerns raised by responses to Risk Assessment questions.\nStrip Search can be undertaken for any offence, but when looking at specific offences, is more likely to be authorised/ conducted for offences relating to drugs or weapons.\nDetainees can be arrested for more than once offence.\nThe number of Detainee’s Strip Searched can be viewed by the following Offence Groups (and where a detainee has been arrested for one or more offences):\n-        Drug offences\n-        Drugs and other offences\n-        Drugs, Weapons and other offences\n-        Other offences\n-        Weapons and other offences\nThe warning Markers on PNC may refer to the individual secreting items on previous occasions or has indications of self-harm/ attempted suicide. It goes without saying that such warning markers have significant impact on decision making with regard to authorising a strip search.\nAny relevant warning markers on PNC are not recorded on the MPS Custody System in a way that allows data analysis. Therefore, one of the main factors in effecting the reasons for a strip search in not available and any conclusion drawn from the information displayed must take this into account.\nWhen reviewing the demographic data in this dashboard it should first be remembered that this relates to the metropolitan custody detainee populations and not to any wider group.\nWhen viewing the entire Custody Population there is initially a disproportionality in the percentages strip searched. However, when various offence groups are examined it will be seen that there is a significant disproportionality in the breakdown of arrests. Also, given that the details of any PNC warning markers are not available, then it follows that any proportionality issues may not be as unambiguous as may first appear. \n\n\n\n\nDue to an internal IT deployment, from 27th February these datasets may be temporarily disrupted. Work is ongoing to rebuild these datasets.\n",

            "summary": "The data used in the MPS Business Crime dashboard is available here Business crime | Metropolitan Police, along with the related data definitions.\n\n\n\nPlease note that, this dataset is updated monthly at the beginning of the month. Data runs until the end of the month prior.\n\n***June 2024: The business crime data-sets are now being extracted and compiled from the new CONNECT system within the MPS; these data-sets will have prefix M1046 added to the file name.*** \n\nThe Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) has introduced CONNECT, a new crime recording system that consolidates several previous systems into one integrated platform. This change aims to streamline processes and enhance efficiency across the board.\n With the implementation of CONNECT, there have been slight modifications in the recording of specific crime categories, such as hate crime. These adjustments may result in minor variations in crime data when compared to the pre-CONNECT era. To provide a comprehensive view of the data, the MPS has regenerated the full report to cover the entire time period.\n\nBCU and Borough data in CONNECT are determined by the geographic location of the incident, rather than the borough managing the case, as was the case with legacy systems. This new approach has been retroactively applied to legacy data to provide consistent and comparable analysis.\n\nBusiness Crime is defined by the National Business Crime Forum (NBCF), the Home Office, and the National Retail Crime Steering Group (NRCSG), chaired by the minister for crime prevention as: \n\n\n  “Any criminal offence that is committed against a person or property which is associated by the connection of that person or property to a business.”  \n\n\n The approach reflects the existing definitions for domestic abuse and hate crime. This means that the victim will determine whether or not the crime has had an impact on a business and, therefore, whether it should be identified as a business crime. This removes any ambiguity about how the crime should be recorded. \n\n\n Not all business crime will be immediately identified as such by the victim or others. For example, an assault in a nightclub might not be identified as a business crime by the victim because they are more likely to perceive it as a personal attack, e.g. motivated by domestic abuse or hate related hostility. \n\n\n Irrespective of the nature of the offending, if the offence took place on business premises it should additionally be recorded as a business crime. This is because criminal offending of any type on business premises may have a negative impact on the business, e.g. increased insurance premiums or, as in the case of the nightclub assault, adverse impact on whether the nightclub’s license is renewed (e.g. too many assault have taken place at that venue). \n\n\n  Further details can be found on the National Business Crime Centre website here:  \n\n\nhttps://nbcc.police.uk/\n",

            "summary": "\nIntroduction\n\n\nThe GiGL Spaces to Visit dataset provides locations and boundaries for open space sites in Greater London that are available to the public as destinations for leisure, activities and community engagement. It includes green corridors that provide opportunities for walking and cycling.\n\n\nThe dataset has been created by Greenspace Information for Greater London CIC (GiGL). As London’s Environmental Records Centre, GiGL mobilises, curates and shares data that underpin our knowledge of London’s natural environment. We provide impartial evidence to support informed discussion and decision making in policy and practice. \n\n\nGiGL maps under licence from the Greater London Authority. \n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThis dataset is a sub-set of the   GiGL Open Space dataset, the most comprehensive dataset available of open spaces in London. Sites are selected for inclusion in Spaces to Visit based on their public accessibility and likelihood that people would be interested in visiting.\nThe dataset is a mapped Geographic Information System (GIS) polygon dataset where one polygon (or multi-polygon) represents one space. As well as site boundaries, the dataset includes information about a site’s name, size and type (e.g. park, playing field etc.).\nGiGL developed the Spaces to Visit dataset to support anyone who is interested in London’s open spaces - including community groups, web and app developers, policy makers and researchers - with an open licence data source. More detailed and extensive data are available under GiGL data use licences for GIGL partners, researchers and students. Information services are also available for ecological consultants, biological recorders and community volunteers – please see www.gigl.org.uk for more information.\nPlease note that access and opening times are subject to change (particularly at the current time) so if you are planning to visit a site check on the local authority or site website that it is open.\nThe dataset is updated on a quarterly basis. If you have questions about this dataset please contact GiGL’s GIS and Data Officer.\n\nData sources\n\n\nThe boundaries and information in this dataset, are a combination of data collected during the London Survey Method habitat and open space survey programme (1986 – 2008) and information provided to GiGL from other sources since. These sources include London borough surveys, land use datasets, volunteer surveys, feedback from the public, park friends’ groups, and updates made as part of GiGL’s on-going data validation and verification process. \n\n\nDue to data availability, some areas are more up-to-date than others. We are continually working on updating and improving this dataset. If you have any additional information or corrections for sites included in the Spaces to Visit dataset please contact  GiGL’s GIS and Data Officer.\nNOTE: The dataset contains OS data © Crown copyright and database rights 2024. The site boundaries are based on Ordnance Survey mapping, and the data are published under Ordnance Survey's 'presumption to publish'. When using these data please acknowledge GiGL and Ordnance Survey as the source of the information using the following citation:\n\n‘Dataset created by Greenspace Information for Greater London CIC (GiGL), 2024 – Contains Ordnance Survey and public sector information licensed under the   Open Government Licence v3.0  ’\n",

            "summary": "The data used in the MPS Stop and Search Dashboard is available here Stop and Search Dashboard | Metropolitan Police, along with the related data definitions. Please note that, this dataset is updated monthly at the beginning of the month. Data runs until the end of the month prior.\n \nDefinitions / Counting Rules\n\nStop and Search (S&S) - When an officer stops a member of the public and searches them. The police can only detain members of the public in order to carry out a search when certain conditions have been met. Search powers fall under different areas of legislation which include searching for\n\n- Stolen property\n- Prohibited articles namely offensive weapons or anything used for burglary, theft, deception or criminal damage\n- Drugs\n- Guns\n\nHistorically searches of unattended vehicles and vessels have made up a very low proportion of search activity.\nPACE and Other Stops and Searches - Stops and Searches under PACE (Police and Criminal Evidence Act), S23 Drugs Act, S47 Firearms Act plus a very small number not included in the other categories (e.g. s27(1) Aviation Security Act 1982 or S7 Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol) Act 1985)\nSection 60 Criminal Justice & Public Order Act 1994 (s.60) - Where an authorising officer reasonably believes that serious violence may take place or that persons are carrying dangerous instruments or offensive weapons without good reason they may authorise powers for officers in uniform to stop and search any person or vehicles within a defined area and time period.\nSearch Groupings - Searches within this report are sometimes grouped as either Weapons, ASB or Key Crime searches. The Weapons group is composed of stops recorded under codes C - Firearms (s47 Firearms Act), D - Offensive Weapons (s1 PACE), K - Anticipated Violence (s60 CJPO). The ASB group is composed of codes B - Drugs (s23 Misuse of Drugs Act), L- Criminal Damage (s1 Pace), Y- Psychoactive Substances, Z - Fireworks (s1 Pace). The Key Crime Group is composed of codes A - Stolen Property (s1 PACE), F- Going Equipped (s1 PACE).\nPositive Outcomes - A Positive Outcome is any outcome other than 'No Further Action (NFA)'The Positive Outcome rate is determined by dividing the number of positive outcomes by the total number of searches.\nEthnic Appearance - The ethnicity of the person stopped as perceived by the officer. For further information on the mapping of 4+1 groupings to 18+1 census data please see HO report Statistics on Race and the Criminal Justice System 2010 at http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pubsstatistical.html\n\nSelf Defined Ethnicity (SDE) - The ethnic group as defined by the person stopped (National Census categories).\nThis report uses 2011 Census data. This is held in 18+1 format and the recorded ethnic appearance of the Stop/Search (4+1) must be mapped to the appropriate 18+1 Census categories. The categories are mapped as follows:\n\nWhite = White British, White Irish, White Gypsy or Irish Traveller, and any other White Background.\nBlack = Black or Black British, Caribbean, African, Mixed White and Black Caribbean, Mixed White and Black African, and any other Black Background\nAsian = Asian or Asian British Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Chinese, Mixed White and Asian and any other Asian background.\nOther = Arab, and any other Ethnic Group\n \nCaveats\n\nThe Borough shown is location of search and not necessarily the borough of the officer conducting the search.\nThe ethnicity of persons stopped and searched within the central London area are unlikely to reflect the resident population due to large numbers of both British and foreign tourists in this region.\nThe MPS fully recognises the distress to the individual which any type of search where intimate parts are exposed can cause, and does not seek to downplay this. However, dip sampling of records has shown that historically some of the records included in this dashboard were wrongly recorded as MTIPs, when they were in fact strip searches conducted in custody after arrest. There will therefore be some double counting, as these will also have been recorded on our custody system and will be therefore be counted in both this dashboard and the separate strip search dashboard.\n\n \n\nNB Data uploaded to this area after February 2024 is sourced from the CONNECT system. Some measures\\details previously provided may not be available in total or in part. Please take care when comparing data-sets posted after February 2024 with those posted prior.\n",

            "summary": "The data used in the MPS Stop and Search – More Thorough Searches Intimate Parts Exposed (MTIPS) dashboard is available here More Thorough Searches Intimate Parts Exposed (MTIPS) Dashboard | Metropolitan Police, along with the related data definitions. Please note that, Datasets are updated monthly at the beginning of the month. Please note, this data runs until the end of the month prior.\nDefinitions / Counting Rules\nStop & Search - When an officer stops a member of the public and searches them. The police can only detain members of the public in order to carry out a search when certain conditions have been met. Search powers fall under different areas of legislation which include searching for: Stolen property; Prohibited articles namely offensive weapons or anything used for burglary, theft, deception or criminal damage; Drugs; Guns.\nMore Thorough Searches - As defined by the College of Policing, this is a search involving the removal of more than JOG (jacket, outer coat, gloves) that exposes intimate parts of the body. (Legislation: PACE - Code A, paragraph 3.7)\nStop & Search Positive Outcome - In the context of a Stop & Search, a 'positive outcome' is when the stop results in either a Caution, Community Resolution, Penalty Notice, Postal Charge\\Summons, or Arrest.\nPlease note that ‘Sex’ is recorded as ‘Male’, ‘Female’, ‘Unknown’ and ‘Vehicle Only’ (for vehicle-only searches). There is always a possibility that some MTIPS records will have a gender of ‘Unknown’ and ‘Vehicle Only’, usually as a result of a data recording error, however there are very few. For example, between 01/05/2020 – 19/05/2022, of the 9,168 records where an MTIP was recorded, only 8 records came back with the gender field stating ‘Unknown’ or ‘Vehicle Only’.\nCaveats\nThe MPS fully recognises the distress to the individual which any type of search where intimate parts are exposed can cause, and does not seek to downplay this. However, dip sampling of records has shown that historically some of the records included in this dashboard were wrongly recorded as MTIPs, when they were in fact strip searches conducted in custody after arrest. There will therefore be some double counting, as these will also have been recorded on our custody system and will be therefore be counted in both this dashboard and the separate strip search dashboard.\n\n\n\n\nDue to an internal IT deployment, from 27th February these datasets may be temporarily disrupted. Work is ongoing to rebuild these datasets.\n",

            "summary": "This dataset presents results of a weekly questionnaire sent to a cohort of frontline civil society organisations from April 2020. The results are being used alongside a range of other pieces of intelligence to inform the pan-London response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe week one questionnaire asked organisations a number of profile questions to understand more about the work they do.\nQuestionnaires from week two onwards have asked organisations about patterns of need they are seeing amongst their beneficiary groups in the last week. Responses to these questions are linked back to the week one profile questions, where possible, to understand how responses vary between different types of organisations.\nThis is also an ongoing 'on-boarding' questionnaire sent to new members of the cohort. This replicates the profile questions in the week one questionnaire, allowing the cohort to grow over time.\nThe cohort was recruited using contacts already held by the Greater London Authority, and also incorporated a 'snowball sampling' technique whereby larger infrastructure organisations were encouraged to forward the invite to smaller organisations they work with.\nWhen reading these results, it is important to bear in mind that the cohort is relatively small and not fully representative of all civil society organisations in London. For these reasons, the results should be used alongside other pieces of intelligence and should not be used to make claims about civil society in London as a whole.\nIf you represent a civil society organisation and would like to take part, please email us at civilsociety@london.gov.uk",

            "summary": "\nIntroduction\n\nThe GiGL Open Space Friends Group subset provides locations and boundaries for selected open space sites in Greater London.\nThe chosen sites represent sites that have established Friends Groups in Greater London and are therefore important to local communities, even if they may not be accessible open spaces, or don’t typically function as destinations for leisure, activities and community engagement*.\nFriends Groups are groups of interested local people who come together to protect, enhance and improve their local open space or spaces.\nThe dataset has been created by Greenspace Information for Greater London CIC (GiGL). As London’s Environmental Records Centre, GiGL mobilises, curates and shares data that underpin our knowledge of London’s natural environment. We provide impartial evidence to support informed discussion and decision making in policy and practice.\nGiGL maps under licence from the Greater London Authority. \n*Publicly accessible sites for leisure, activities and community engagement can be found in GiGL's Spaces to Visit dataset\n\nDescription\n\n\nThis dataset is a sub-set of the  GiGL Open Space dataset, the most comprehensive dataset available of open spaces in London. Sites are selected for inclusion in the Friends Group subset based on whether there is a friends group recorded for the site in the Open Space dataset.\nThe dataset is a mapped Geographic Information System (GIS) polygon dataset where one polygon (or multi-polygon) represents one space. As well as site boundaries, the dataset includes information about a site’s name, size, access and type (e.g. park, playing field etc.) and the name and/or web address of the site’s friends group.\nGiGL developed the dataset to support anyone who is interested in identifying sites in London with friends groups - including friends groups and other community groups, web and app developers, policy makers and researchers - with an open licence data source. More detailed and extensive data are available under GiGL data use licences for GIGL partners, researchers and students. Information services are also available for ecological consultants, biological recorders, community groups and members of the public – please see www.gigl.org.uk for more information.\nThe dataset is updated on a quarterly basis. If you have questions about this dataset please contact GiGL’s GIS and Data Officer.\n\nData sources\n\n\nThe boundaries and information in this dataset are a combination of data collected during the London Survey Method habitat and open space survey programme (1986 – 2008) and information provided to GiGL from other sources since. These sources include London borough surveys, land use datasets, volunteer surveys, feedback from the public, park friends’ groups, and updates made as part of GiGL’s on-going data validation and verification process. \n\n\nThis is a preliminary version of the dataset as there is currently low coverage of friends groups in GiGL’s Open Space database. We are continually working on updating and improving this dataset. If you have any additional information or corrections for sites included in GiGL’s Friends Group subset please contact  GiGL’s GIS and Data Officer.\nNOTE: The dataset contains OS data © Crown copyright and database rights 2024. The site boundaries are based on Ordnance Survey mapping, and the data are published under Ordnance Survey's 'presumption to publish'.

            "summary": "The data used in the MPS Crime Dashboard is available here MPS Crime Dashboard | Metropolitan Police, along with the related data definitions. Please note that datasets are updated monthly on the 6th of the month. Data runs until the end of the month prior.\n\n***June 2024: The MPS monthly crime data-sets are now being extracted and compiled from the new CONNECT system within the MPS; these data-sets will have prefix M1045 added to the file name.*** \n\nThe Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) has introduced CONNECT, a new crime recording system that consolidates several previous systems into one integrated platform. This change aims to streamline processes and enhance efficiency across the board.\n\nAt the end of February 2024 the MPS started using CONNECT to record crime and investigation data. There is a difference in how Hate Crime and Domestic Abuse are recorded on CONNECT compared with the legacy crime recording system of CRIS and for this reason, Hate Crime and Domestic Abuse figures pre an post March are not comparable.\n\n\nBCU and Borough data in CONNECT are determined by the geographic location of the incident, rather than the borough managing the case, as was the case with legacy systems. This new approach has been retroactively applied to legacy data to provide consistent and comparable analysis.\nTotal Notifiable Offence (TNO) data follows the Home Office counting rules for recorded crime (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/counting-rules-for-recorded-crime ).   NB   This data-set includes “Other Accepted Crime”, which are non-notifiable crimes and must be excluded if calculating a TNO total.\n\nThe “Other Crime” offence data follows the Home Office counting rules but have been grouped by specific features (e.g. Knife Crime): please see dashboard for definitions.  NB \"Hate Crime\" totals do NOT include records that are flagged solely as 'domestic abuse'.\nMeasures include Offences, Positive Outcomes, and the Positive Outcome Rate (total number of positive outcomes divided by the total number of offences in a given period).\nAll data is broken down by financial year for each crime type.",

            "summary": "This dataset provides information about earnings of employees who are working in an area, who are on adult rates and whose pay for the survey pay-period was not affected by absence.\nTables provided here include total gross weekly earnings, and full time weekly earnings with breakdowns by gender, and annual median, mean and lower quartile earnings by borough and UK region. These are provided both in nominal and real terms.\nReal earnings figures are on sheets labelled \"real\", are in 2016 prices, and calculated by applying ONS’s annual CPI index series for April to ASHE data.\nAnnual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) is based on a sample of employee jobs taken from HM Revenue & Customs PAYE records. Information on earnings and hours is obtained in confidence from employers. ASHE does not cover the self-employed nor does it cover employees not paid during the reference period.\nThe earnings information presented relates to gross pay before tax, National Insurance or other deductions, and excludes payments in kind.\nThe confidence figure is the coefficient of variation (CV) of that estimate. The CV is the ratio of the standard error of an estimate to the estimate itself and is expressed as a percentage. The smaller the coefficient of variation the greater the accuracy of the estimate. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV.\nResults for 2003 and earlier exclude supplementary surveys. In 2006 there were a number of methodological changes made. For further details goto : http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/articles/341.aspx. The headline statistics for ASHE are based on the median rather than the mean. The median is the value below which 50 per cent of employees fall. It is ONS's preferred measure of average earnings as it is less affected by a relatively small number of very high earners and the skewed distribution of earnings. It therefore gives a better indication of typical pay than the mean.\nSurvey data from a sample frame, use caution if using for performance measurement and trend analysis '#' These figures are suppressed as statistically unreliable. ! Estimate and confidence interval not available since the group sample size is zero or disclosive (0-2).\nFurthermore, data from Abstract of Regional Statistics, New Earnings Survey and ASHE have been combined to create long run historical series of full-time weekly earnings data for London and Great Britain, stretching back to 1965, and is broken down by sex.",

For 2013/14 and 2011/12 the figures are average weekly income.\nThey are calculated using a model based method to produce the following four estimates of income using a combination of survey data from the Family Resources Survey, and previously published data from the 2011 Census and a number of administrative data sources. The four different measures of income are:\n\nTotal household income\nNet household income\nNet household income (equivalised) before housing costs\nNet household income (equivalised) after housing costs\n\nTotal annual household income is the sum of the gross income of every member of the household plus any income from benefits such as Working Families Tax Credit.\nNet annual household income is the sum of the net income of every member of the household. It is calculated using the same components as total income but income is net of:\n\nincome tax payments;\nnational insurance contributions;\ndomestic rates/council tax;\ncontributions to occupational pension schemes;\nall maintenance and child support payments, which are deducted from the income of the person making the payments; and\nparental contribution to students living away from home.\n\nNet annual household income before housing costs (equivalised) is composed of the same elements as net household weekly income but is subject to the OECD’s equivalisation scale.\nNet annual household income after housing costs (equivalised) is composed of the same elements of net household weekly income but is subject to the following deductions prior to the OECD’s equivalisation scale being applied:\n\nrent (gross of housing benefit);\nwater rates, community water charges and council water charges;\nmortgage interest payments (net of any tax relief);\nstructural insurance premiums (for owner occupiers); and\nground rent and service charges.\n\nFor detailed information on aspects of the quality and methodology behind these statistics, see the Technical Report.\n\nThis dataset is included in the Greater London Authority's Night Time Observatory.

            "summary": "This CSV table shows a breakdown of the dwelling stock down to a lower geographic level Lower layer Super Output Area or LSOA, categorised by the property build period and property type. CSV metadata.\nCounts in the tables are rounded to the nearest 10 with those below 5 recorded as negligible and appearing as -. Data on build period, or age of property, has been used to create 12 property build period categories: Pre-1900, 1900-1918, 1919-1929, 1930-1939, 1945-1954, 1955-1964, 1965-1972, 1973-1982, 1983-1992, 1993-1999, 2000-2009, and 2010-2015.\nData on property type includes breakdown by bungalow, terraced, flat/maisonette, semi-detached and detached, and by the number of bedrooms. The counts are calculated from domestic property data for England and Wales extracted from the Valuation Office Agencys administrative database on 31 March 2015, and on 1 August 2012 and 31 March 2014. The VOA have published data that shows homes by period built, or type, and council tax band down to MSOA and LSOA level.\nRounding: Small differences between the rounding conventions are applied to the 2014 and 2015 statistics. For 2014 The rounding convention applied to the tables: Counts are rounded to the nearest 10 dwellings and counts less than 5 are reported as negligible (-). For 2015 The rounding convention applied to the tables: Counts are rounded to the nearest 10 with counts of zero being reported as \"0\" and counts fewer than 5 reported as negligible and denoted by \"-\".\nNational Statistics Postcode Lookup file (NSPL): Different NSPL files have been used for 2014 and 2015 statistics (February 2014 NSLP used February 2015 NSLP used). As a results, postcodes can be moved in different OAs. Further information on NSPL can be found at ONS\nProperty attributes: As part of the day to day VOA work, attributes information can be added (where no information is recorded) and/or changed (existing information is updated). This would result in counts in categories changing.\nNew entries and deletions: New entries into the CT List together with deletions from the CT List will result in changes to counts. New entries could be as a result from splits, mergers, new build but also entries which were not previously in the CT List i.e. a shop is converted in a domestic property. Similarly, deletions could be as a result from splits, mergers, demolitions but also entries no longer domestic properties i.e. a house is converted into a shop (non-domestic property). The map below was created to show the average age of properties at MSOA level. View an interactive map presentation (using Tableau) of the build period data for MSOAs and boroughs.\n \n",

The current NLUD assessment covers sites in excess of 0.25ha. This project validates, checks and updates this information for existing NLUD sites plus new sites down to a smaller threshold of 0.1 hectares and above. \n\nThe Database records over 2,000 Brownfield sites across London, equivalent to more than 2% of the land in Greater London (an increase of over 1,000 sites than recorded on the previous system).  The Homes and Communities Agency will use the database as their preferred platform for boroughs to record brownfield sites. \n\nThe London Database uses Geographic Information Systems (GIS) mapping. It includes transport routes, deprivation, social infrastructure, as well as heritage and natural environment assets that can be overlaid over the dataset of brownfield land.
