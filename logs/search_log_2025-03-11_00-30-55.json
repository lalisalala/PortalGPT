            "summary": "This table shows the average House Price/Earnings ratio, which is an important indicator of housing affordability. Ratios are calculated by dividing house price by the median earnings of a borough.\nThe Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) is based on a 1 per cent sample of employee jobs. Information on earnings and hours is obtained in confidence from employers. It does not cover the self-employed nor does it cover employees not paid during the reference period. Information is as at April each year. The statistics used are workplace based full-time individual earnings.\nPre-2013 Land Registry housing data are for the first half of the year only, so that they are comparable to the ASHE data which are as at April. This is no longer the case from 2013 onwards as this data uses house price data from the ONS House Price Statistics for Small Areas statistical release. Prior to 2006 data are not available for Inner and Outer London.\nThe lowest 25 per cent of prices are below the lower quartile; the highest 75 per cent are above the lower quartile. The \"lower quartile\" property price/income is determined by ranking all property prices/incomes in ascending order. The 'median' property price/income is determined by ranking all property prices/incomes in ascending order. The point at which one half of the values are above and one half are below is the median.\nRegional data has not been published by DCLG since 2012. Data for regions has been calculated by the GLA. Data since 2014 has been calculated by the GLA using Land Registry house prices and ONS Earnings data.\nLink to DCLG Live Tables\nAn interactive map showing the affordability ratios by local authority for 2013, 2014 and 2015 is also available.",

            "summary": "This dataset includes the locations and species information for over 880,000 of London's trees. It also includes additional information such as size and age for some of these trees. These are predominantly street trees, but also some trees in parks and other open spaces.\nThe data does not represent the entirety of the capital's urban forest - the London iTree report estimated that there are over eight million trees in London, which includes trees in woodlands, parks, streets, private gardens and more. The data includes 26 of London's 33 boroughs, the City of London and Transport for London.\nAs recognised in the London Urban Forest Plan, collating data about London's urban forest is challenging due to the number of landowners and managers involved, as well as the limited resources available. The Plan committed to undertaking regular updates to this map, and also, over time, to collating a London-wide inventory of publicly owned and managed trees, in line with emerging national standards.\nThe data is used on the London Street Tree Map.\n\nNotes on the data:\n\nThe data on the map includes data provided in 2014-15, during initial data collection, and updated data provided in 2019-20. Where boroughs did not provide updated data in 2019-20, the 2014-15 data has been retained. However, trees may have been surveyed some time before this and so some records may be several years old.\nThe map includes data from 26 of the London boroughs, the City of London and Transport for London (TfL). TfL trees are shown London-wide.\nData has not been received to date from six boroughs. We aim to add any additional data received to the  Datastore  and online map.\nSome large gaps on the map are due to large green spaces (including the Royal Parks), reservoirs, or airports, as well as those boroughs where data is missing.\nThe data received varies significantly by borough. Some boroughs have only included trees on highways, whilst others have included trees on housing land, in schools or in parks. In some cases trees were recorded only when work was carried out.\nThere is not a consistent or agreed format for collecting or recording tree data across London. This presents a challenge in collating data across multiple boroughs. Many boroughs collect a range of information about their trees (e.g. age, height). However this varied by borough in terms of the information collected and categorisations used so we were not able to standardise this information.\nTree species data has been standardised the names to come up with a simplified common name for display on the tree webmap (e. g. “Pear”). These are the common names for the 24 types of tree appearing most frequently in the data (which encompass 90% of all trees), with the remaining trees categorised as “Other”. We have also left the species name as provided by the borough in the data.\nThe ‘tree ID’ number has been added to the data to help map it. This number is not linked to borough’s tree management systems.\n\n\n\n\n   \n\nWarning: Large file size may result in a long download time\n",

            "summary": "The ward profiles and ward atlas provide a range of demographic and related data for each ward in Greater London. They are designed to provide an overview of the population in these small areas by presenting a range of data on the population, diversity, households, life expectancy, housing, crime, benefits, land use, deprivation, and employment.\nIndicators included here are population by age and sex, land area, projections, population density, household composition, religion, ethnicity, birth rates (general fertility rate), death rates (standardised mortality ratio), life expectancy, average house prices, properties sold, housing by council tax band, tenure, property size (bedrooms), dwelling build period and type, mortgage and landlord home repossession, employment and economic activity, Incapacity Benefit, Housing Benefit, Household income, Income Support and JobSeekers Allowance claimant rates, dependent children receiving child-tax credits by lone parents and out-of-work families, child poverty, National Insurance Number registration rates for overseas nationals (NINo), GCSE results, A-level / Level 3 results (average point scores), pupil absence, child obesity, crime rates (by type of crime), fires, ambulance call outs, road casualties, happiness and well-being, land use, public transport accessibility (PTALs), access to public greenspace, access to nature, air emissions / quality, car use, bicycle travel, Indices of Deprivation, and election turnout.\nThe Ward Profiles present key summary measures for the most recent year, using both Excel and InstantAtlas mapping software. This is a useful tool for displaying a large amount of data for numerous geographies, in one place.\nThe Ward Atlas presents a more detailed version of the data including trend data and generally includes the raw numbers as opposed to percentages or rates.\nThe Instant Atlas reports use HTML5 technology, which can be used in modern browsers, including on Apple machines, but will not function on older browsers.\n\nWARD ATLAS FOR 2014 BOUNDARIES\n\nIn May 2014, ward boundaries changed in Hackney, Kensington and Chelsea, and Tower Hamlets. This version of the ward atlas gives data for these new wards, as well as retaining data on the unchanged wards in the rest of London for comparison purposes. Data for boroughs has also been included.\nVery few datasets have been published for the new ward boundaries, so the majority of data contained in this atlas have been modelled using a method of proportion of households from the old boundaries that are located in the new boundaries. Therefore, the data contained in this atlas are indicative only.\n\nInstant Atlas for 2014 Ward Atlas \n\n \nTips:\n\n- Select a new indicator from the Data box on the left. Select the theme, then indicator and then year to show the data.\n- To view data just for one borough*, use the filter tool.\n- Some legend settings can be altered by clicking on the cog icon next to the Wards tick box within the map legend.\n- The wards can be ranked in order by clicking at the top of the indicator column of the data table.\n\nNote: Additional indicator information and sources are included within the spreadsheet and Instant Atlas report.\nOTHER SMALL AREA PROFILES\nOther profiles available include Borough, LSOA and MSOA atlases.\nData from these profiles were used to create the Well-being scores tool.\n\n*The London boroughs are: City of London, Barking and Dagenham, Barnet, Bexley, Brent, Bromley, Camden, Croydon, Ealing, Enfield, Greenwich, Hackney, Hammersmith and Fulham, Haringey, Harrow, Havering, Hillingdon, Hounslow, Islington, Kensington and Chelsea, Kingston upon Thames, Lambeth, Lewisham, Merton, Newham, Redbridge, Richmond upon Thames, Southwark, Sutton, Tower Hamlets, Waltham Forest, Wandsworth, Westminster.\n\nThese profiles were created using the most up to date information available at the time of collection (September 2015).",

            "title": "House Price per Square Metre in England and Wales",
            "summary": "This house price per square metre dataset is created through complex address-based matching between the Land Registry’s Price Paid Data (LR-PPD) and property size information from the Domestic Energy Performance Certificates (EPC) data published by the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC, formerly MHCLG). Details of the data linkage are published in the UCL Open: Environment along with the related linkage code via the UK Data Service ReShare repository.\nDuring this data linkage process, the transactions assigned as category B (Additional Price Paid entry) and other property types are removed. Here we publish our latest limited attribute version of the uncorrected house price per square metre dataset in England and Wales with the LR-PPD data (1/1/1995-26/2/2021) and Domestic EPCs data (the sixth version, up to 20/9/2020) downloaded on 1/4/2021 for non-commercial purpose. This uncorrected version of house price per square metre dataset records over 18 million transactions with 16 variables in England and Wales since 1995. Unlike in our published article, in this uncorrected version we have not removed transactions with any improbable price per square metre values - i.e. where either the transaction price or total floor area values are null, 0 or too low to be realistic. This uncorrected version of the data will offer the most flexibility for researchers.\nWe offer technical validation and data cleaning code via the UKDA ReShare repository to help users evaluate the representation of the linked data for a given time period. The data cleaning code shows our methods for cleaning up unlikely floor size records before using this data in analysis. Users can create their own rules and undertake this clean-up process based on their own experience and research aims.\nThis limited attribute version is published by local authority (2021 version). Details of the 16 variables are described in the explanation file. The National Statistics Postcode Lookup NSPL (May 2021 version) is used to assign the local authority unit for your production of area-based statistics. Users can match historical changes in LA boundaries by choosing appropriate aggregations using, for instance ONSPD, and the postcode variable in our dataset.\nAn extended version of this dataset containing additional variables is available from UK Data Service Reshare service. Users can directly access this full version dataset (tranall_link_01042021.zip) via the following link:  https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/855033/ . Accompanying LR-PPD and EPC data are also supplied through the ReShare service. Users who would like to attach their own additional variables from the LR-PPD data are advised to use the transactionid variable to link to the LR-PPD (LRPPD_01042021.zip). Users who would like to attach additional variables from the EPC data are advised to use the id variable to link to the sixth version Domestic EPCs (epc6_id.zip). \n\nThe 2024 update\n\n\nThe 2024 updated version of the house price per square metre dataset extends the data coverage to the end of 2024 (\nhpm_la_2024.zip\n). This new version is the result of linking LR-PPD data (01/01/1995–31/10/2024) and Domestic EPCs data (up to 31/10/2024), downloaded on 26/12/2024 for non-commercial purposes. It records over 22 million transactions in England and Wales since 1995.\n\n\nUnlike the previous versions, this updated removes the id variable (created by the authors) and adds the lmk_key variable (originally from the Domestic EPCs dataset). This change was made because the lmk_key serves as a unique identifier with no duplicate records since 2024.\n\n\nThe match rate of the linked data varies over time; therefore, we recommend users carefully choose the time coverage and validate the data coverage using the match rate. Please note that publicly available Domestic EPCs data starts in 2008, resulting in an extremely low match rate for the period between 1995 and 2008.\n\n\nThe National Statistics Postcode Lookup (November 2024 version) is used to assign local authorities (2023 version) for this publication. An extended version of this dataset, containing additional variables from LR-PPD and Domestic EPCs, will be available from the UK Data Service Reshare platform.\n\n\nAlternatively, users can use the lmk_key variable to link additional variables from the Domestic EPCs dataset or use the transactionid to add in other information from the LR-PPD dataset.\n\n\nThe 2023 update\n\n\n In 2023, a third updated version of the house price per square metre dataset has been published on the London Datastore ( hpm_la_2023.zip ). This new version extends the data coverage to 2023, but keeps the same publication format as the first publication. The new version is the linked result based on LR-PPD data (1/1/1995-31/10/2023) and Domestic EPCs data (end with 31/10/2023) downloaded on 2/12/2023 for non-commercial purposes. This uncorrected version of the house price per square metre dataset records almost 21 million transactions in England and Wales since 1995.\nThe match rate of this linked data varies across time, thus we suggest the user chooses the time coverage needed based on their own research. The id variable has been newly generated for this new version of the Domestic EPC dataset published by DLUHC at the end of the 2023, so it is not the same as the id variable in our previous publication( hpm_la.zip   or    hpm_la_2022.zip ) and should not be used to link between the new and the previous publication.\n\n The National Statistics Postcode Lookup NSPL (November 2023 version) is used to assign the local authority unit for this second publication. An extended version of this dataset containing additional variables from LR-PPD and Domestic EPCs will be available in due course from UK Data Service Reshare service.\n\nThe 2022 update\n\nIn 2022, a second updated version of the house price per square metre dataset has been published on the London Datastore (hpm_la_2022.zip). This new version extends the data coverage to 2022, but keeps the same publication format as the first publication. The new version is the linked result based on LR-PPD data (1/1/1995-27/6/2022) and Domestic EPCs data (the twelfth version: end with 30/6/2022) downloaded on 13/8/2022 for non-commercial purposes. This uncorrected version of the house price per square metre dataset records almost 20 million transactions in England and Wales since 1995.\nThe match rate of this linked data before 2008 is lower, thus we suggest the user chooses the time coverage needed based on their own research. The id variable has been newly generated for this new data from the twelfth version of the Domestic EPC dataset published by DLUHC, so it is not the same as the id variable in our previous publication(hpm_la.zip) and should not be used to link between the new and the previous publication.\n\nThe National Statistics Postcode Lookup NSPL (August 2022 version) is used to assign the local authority unit for this second publication. An extended version of this dataset containing additional variables from LR-PPD and Domestic EPCs is available on the UK Data Service (  https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/856204/  )\n",

It also estimates the cost of repairing all the homes in London that are in poor condition, calculating how long it would take the savings to pay off the repair costs. The analysis is broken down by tenure and compared with the same figures for the rest of England.\nPrevious Housing Research Notes have analysed topics including housing supply, Help to Buy policy, short-term lettings, international comparisons, the factors behind increasing private rents and race equality. ",

            "summary": "FOCUSONLONDON2010:INCOMEANDSPENDINGATHOME\n\nHousehold income in London far exceeds that of any other region in the UK. At £900 per week, London’s gross weekly household income is 15 per cent higher than the next highest region. Despite this, the costs to each household are also higher in the capital. Londoners pay a greater amount of their income in tax and national insurance than the UK average as well as footing a higher bill for housing and everyday necessities. All of which leaves London households less well off than the headline figures suggest.\n\nThis chapter, authored by Richard Walker in the GLA Intelligence Unit, begins with an analysis of income at both individual and household level, before discussing the distribution and sources of income. This is followed by a look at wealth and borrowing and finally, focuses on expenditure including an insight to the cost of housing in London, compared with other regions in the UK.\n\nSee other reports from this Focus on London series.\n\nREPORT:\n\nTo view the report online click on the image below.\n   Income and Spending Report PDF\n\n\n\nPRESENTATION:\n\nThis interactive presentation finds the answer to the question, who really is better off, an average London or UK household?

Rents data are based on the financial year.\nStock figures used to estimate the average for each county, region and the nation are taken at 1st April of the following financial year. Average rents data between 2003/04 and 2007/08 inclusively is based on total stock figures from Housing Revenue Account (HRA) audited base claim form. Before 2003/04 the average rents data is based on total stock figures from the Housing Revenue Account (HRA) second subsidy claim form.\nRents data for 2008/09 are based on total stock figures as at the beginning of the financial year. This data is taken from the HRA subsidy base data form. Average rent data for this year are provisional and will be updated when stock data at the start of the following financial year become available.\nFor a few authorities no rent figure is given because the stock is now very small and the authority no longer reports average rents. For some local authorities the average rent for 2003/04 is lower than in 2002/03. This may be due to some local authorities supplying net rents excluding service charges from 2003/04 onwards. Prior to 2003/04 some of them may have been including service charges in their rent figures. Average rent figures do not account for stock composition.\n'LSVT': all or most of the local authority stock has been transferred to the RSL sector, so the average rent is no longer applicable. LSVTs are not taken into account when calculating county, regional or national averages. MYT (Mid-Year Transfer) refers to those authorities that have transferred their stock in full, part way through the financial year.\nWhere a local authority has transferred part of it's stock mid-year, the stock figure used to estimate averages is taken as at 1st April the following financial year. MYT information is provided from 2003/04 onwards only. Prior to 2003/04 average rents figures may be based on stock figures at the start of the financial year prior to any mid-year transfer.\nThe districts, unitary authorities and counties listed above are based on 1 April 1998 boundaries. Figures for any 'new' re-organised areas have been estimated retrospectively applying the new boundaries back to 1996. Average rents data for 2003/04 and onwards are based on a standardised 52 week collection. Data prior to 2003/04 may have been reported on various different collection scales. Average rent is calculated from stock-owning local authorities that have provided data.\nView Live Tables on Rents and Tenancies on DCLG website\nAverage rents for council owned stock are reported in section H of the Local Authority Housing Statistics data",

It therefore does not provide a complete picture of debt in London, but helps to understand the characteristics of those seeking debt advice. The data are aggregated from three separate sources, and categories have been matched where possible to provide consistent output. Unknown cases for each variable have been omitted and numbers below 5 have been supressed, so there are different numbers of clients for each variable.\n\nKey Findings\n\n\n\n     -The number of people seeking debt advice varies widely across London, up to more than 200 clients in one year in one postcode sector.\n \n\n     -Around 4 in 10 of those seeking debt advice were in the 35-49 age group\n \n\n     -Londoners seeking debt advice came from across the spectrum of society, owner occupiers to homeless, all age groups and all ethnicities.\n \n\n     -Levels of debt ranged from under £1,000 to over £1,000,000\n \n\nDownload Data\n\n\nCombined debt advice statistics 2010-11\n\n\nCombined debt advice statistics 2011-12\n\n\n\n*Maps\n\nThe GLA has prepared a series of maps visualising the debt advice data.

            "summary": "These ward level well being scores present a combined measure of well-being indicators of the resident population based on 12 different indicators. Where possible each indicator score is compared with the England and Wales average, which is zero. Scores over 0 indicate a higher probability that the population on average will experience better well-being according to these measures.\nUsers can adjust the weight of each indicator depending on what they consider to be the more or less important, thus generating bespoke scores. This is done either by entering a number between 0 and 10. The scores throughout the spreadsheet will update automatically.\nThe tool combines data across a range of themes for the last five years of available data (2009-2013).\nEither view the results in the online interactive tool here,\n\n\n\n\n\nOr download the interactive spreadsheet here \n\n\n\nThe well-being scores are then presented in a ranked bar chart for each borough, and a ward map of London.\nThe spreadsheet also highlights wards in the top and bottom 25 per cent in London. Wards that have shown significant improvement or reduction in their scores relative to the average over the five year period are also highlighted.\nBorough figures are provided to assist with comparisons.\nRankings and summary tables are included. The source data that the tool is based on is included in the spreadsheet.\nThe Excel file is 8.1MB.\nIMPORTANT NOTE, users must enable macros when prompted upon opening the Excel spreadsheet (or reset security to medium/low) for the map to function. The rest of the tool will function without macros.\nIf you cannot download the Excel file directly try this zip file (2.6MB).\nIf you experience any difficulties with downloading this spreadsheet, please contact the London Datastore in the Intelligence Unit.\nDetailed information about definitions and sources is contained within the spreadsheet.\nThe 12 measures included are:\nHealth \n - Life Expectancy\n - Childhood Obesity\n - Incapacity Benefits claimant rate\nEconomic security\n - Unemployment rate\nSafety\n - Crime rate\n - Deliberate Fires\nEducation\n - GCSE point scores\nChildren\n - Unauthorised Pupil Absence\nFamilies\n - Children in out-of-work households\nTransport\n - Public Transport Accessibility Scores (PTALs)\nEnvironment\n - Access to public open space & nature\nHappiness\n - Composite Subjective Well-being Score (Life Satisfaction, Worthwhileness, Anxiety, and Happiness) (New data only available since 2011/12)\nWith some measures if the data shows a high figure that indicates better well-being, and with other measures a low figure indicates better well-being. Therefore scores for Life Expectancy, GCSE scores, PTALs, and Access to Public Open Space/Nature have been reversed so that in all measures low scores indicate probable lower well-being.\nThe data has been turned into scores where each indicator in each year has a standard deviation of 10. This means that each indicator will have an equal effect on the final score when the weightings are set to equal.\nWhy should measuring well-being be important to policy makers? \n Following research by the Cabinet Office and Office for National Statistics, the government is aiming to develop policy that is more focused on ‘all those things that make life worthwhile’ (David Cameron, November 2010). They are interested in developing new and better ways to understand how policy and public services affect well-being.\nWhy measure well-being for local areas?\n It is important for London policy makers to consider well-being at a local level (smaller than borough level) because of the often huge differences within boroughs. Local authorities rely on small area data in order to target resources, and with local authorities currently gaining more responsibilities from government, this is of increasing importance. But small area data is also of interest to academics, independent analysts and members of the public with an interest in the subject of well-being.\nHow can well-being be measured within small areas?\n The Office for National Statistics have been developing new measures of national well-being, and as part of this, at a national and regional level, the ONS has published some subjective data to measure happiness. ONS have not measured well-being for small areas, so this tool has been designed to fill this gap. However, DCLG have published a tool that models life satisfaction data for LSOAs based on a combination of national level happiness data, and 'ACORN' data. Happiness data is not available for small areas because there are no surveys large enough for this level of detail, and so at this geography the focus is on objective indicators. Data availability for small areas is far more limited than for districts, and this means the indicators that the scores are based on are not all perfect measures of well-being, though they are the best available. However, by using a relatively high number of measures across a number of years, this increases the reliability of the well-being scores.\nHow can this tool be used to help policy makers?\n Each neighbourhood will have its own priorities, but the data in this tool could help provide a solid evidence base for informed local policy-making, and the distribution of regeneration funds. In addition, it could assist users to identify the causes behind an improvement in well-being in certain wards, where examples of good practice could be applied elsewhere.\nDifferences to the previous report\nThis is the 2013 edition of this publication, and there is one change from 2012. Indicators of Election turnout has been replaced with a composite score of subjective well-being indicators.\nPast versions are still available for 2011 and 2012. The rationale/methodology paper from 2011 is here. The scores from the 2012 spreadsheet are also available in PDF format. The scores in Intelligence Update 21-2012 are based on equal weightings across each measure.\nThis tool was created by the GLA Intelligence Unit.

It includes green corridors that provide opportunities for walking and cycling.\n\n\nThe dataset has been created by Greenspace Information for Greater London CIC (GiGL). As London’s Environmental Records Centre, GiGL mobilises, curates and shares data that underpin our knowledge of London’s natural environment. We provide impartial evidence to support informed discussion and decision making in policy and practice. \n\n\nGiGL maps under licence from the Greater London Authority. \n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThis dataset is a sub-set of the   GiGL Open Space dataset, the most comprehensive dataset available of open spaces in London. Sites are selected for inclusion in Spaces to Visit based on their public accessibility and likelihood that people would be interested in visiting.\nThe dataset is a mapped Geographic Information System (GIS) polygon dataset where one polygon (or multi-polygon) represents one space. As well as site boundaries, the dataset includes information about a site’s name, size and type (e.g. park, playing field etc.).\nGiGL developed the Spaces to Visit dataset to support anyone who is interested in London’s open spaces - including community groups, web and app developers, policy makers and researchers - with an open licence data source. More detailed and extensive data are available under GiGL data use licences for GIGL partners, researchers and students. Information services are also available for ecological consultants, biological recorders and community volunteers – please see www.gigl.org.uk for more information.\nPlease note that access and opening times are subject to change (particularly at the current time) so if you are planning to visit a site check on the local authority or site website that it is open.\nThe dataset is updated on a quarterly basis. If you have questions about this dataset please contact GiGL’s GIS and Data Officer.\n\nData sources\n\n\nThe boundaries and information in this dataset, are a combination of data collected during the London Survey Method habitat and open space survey programme (1986 – 2008) and information provided to GiGL from other sources since. These sources include London borough surveys, land use datasets, volunteer surveys, feedback from the public, park friends’ groups, and updates made as part of GiGL’s on-going data validation and verification process. \n\n\nDue to data availability, some areas are more up-to-date than others. We are continually working on updating and improving this dataset. If you have any additional information or corrections for sites included in the Spaces to Visit dataset please contact  GiGL’s GIS and Data Officer.\nNOTE: The dataset contains OS data © Crown copyright and database rights 2024. The site boundaries are based on Ordnance Survey mapping, and the data are published under Ordnance Survey's 'presumption to publish'.

            "summary": "FOCUSONLONDON2011: HOUSING:AGROWINGCITY\n\nWith the highest average incomes in the country but the least space to grow, demand for housing in London has long outstripped supply, resulting in higher housing costs and rising levels of overcrowding. The pressures of housing demand in London have grown in recent years, in part due to fewer people leaving London to buy homes in other regions. But while new supply during the recession held up better in London than in other regions, it needs to increase significantly in order to meet housing needs and reduce housing costs to more affordable levels.\n\nThis edition of Focus on London authored by James Gleeson in the Housing Unit looks at housing trends in London, from the demand/supply imbalance to the consequences for affordability and housing need.\n\nREPORT:\n\nRead the report in PDF format.\n\n\n\nPRESENTATION:\n\nHow much pressure is London’s popularity putting on housing provision in the capital? This interactive presentation looks at the effect on housing pressure of demographic changes, and recent new housing supply, shown by trends in overcrowding and house prices.

Please use the UK House Price Index instead.\nMix-adjusted house prices, by new/pre-owned dwellings, type of buyer (first time buyer) and region, from February 2002 for London and UK, and average mix-adjusted prices by UK region, and long term Annual House Price Index data since 1969 for London.\nThe ONS House Price Index is mix-adjusted to allow for differences between houses sold (for example type, number of rooms, location) in different months within a year. House prices are modelled using a combination of characteristics to produce a model containing around 100,000 cells (one such cell could be first-time buyer, old dwelling, one bedroom flat purchased in London). Each month estimated prices for all cells are produced by the model and then combined with their appropriate weight to produce mix-adjusted average prices. The index values are based on growth rates in the mix-adjusted average house prices and are annually chain linked.\nThe weights used for mix-adjustment change at the start of each calendar year (i.e. in January). The mix-adjusted prices are therefore not comparable between calendar years, although they are comparable within each calendar year. If you wish to calculate change between years, you should use the mix-adjusted house price index, available in Table 33.\nThe data published in these tables are based on a sub-sample of RMS data. These results will therefore differ from results produced using full sample data. For further information please contact the ONS using the contact details below.  House prices, mortgage advances and incomes have been rounded to the nearest £1,000.  Data taken from Table 2 and Table 9 of the monthly ONS release.\nDownload from ONS website",

To help target where action is most needed, the Mayor has developed a London Building Stock Model with the UCL Energy Institute.

It provides a snapshot of all London’s buildings (both domestic and non-domestic) with information on their energy performance certificates as of 2017.\n\nMore information is available here, and an interactive map is available here.\nMost of the data from the London Building Stock Model interactive map has been made available through the data extracts below. Please note that the data extracts are based on Ordnance Survey's list of London properties as of 2023. However, as the London Building Stock Model data is from 2017, some of the properties might not have any London Building Stock Model data attached to them.\nThe data contains Ordnance Survey mapping and the data is published under Ordnance Survey's 'presumption to publish'. © Crown copyright and database rights 2023\n",

            "summary": "\nDataset last updated: 8th January 2025\n\nThis dataset provides indicative areas of biodiversity hotspots in Greater London, identified by research and data analysis using methods derived from the Greater London Authority’s (GLA) “Planning for Biodiversity?” report (2016).\nThe dataset has been created by Greenspace Information for Greater London CIC (GiGL). GiGL mobilises, curates and shares data that underpin our knowledge of London’s natural environment. We provide impartial evidence to enable informed discussion and decision-making in policy and practice. The dataset is based on GiGL partnership data which are continuously updated.\nThe underlying data for the dataset may have been subject to changes since the current version was modelled. Subsequent versions will provide updated information from the GiGL database annually. The dataset is a coarse-resolution presentation of high-resolution data. To access data at their original resolution, please contact GiGL or visit www.gigl.org.uk for more information.\nResearch for this dataset has been assisted by London and South East England Local Records Centres (LaSER) and the London Boroughs Biodiversity Forum (LBBF), and is based on advice provided by the Open Data Institute (ODI).\n\n\n\nDescription\nTo meet Policy G6 D of The London Plan (2021), the capital’s spatial development strategy, \" Development proposals should manage impacts on biodiversity and aim to secure net biodiversity gain. This should be informed by the best available ecological information and addressed from the start of the development process\".\n\nThe Biodiversity Hotspots for Planning (BHP) dataset provides developers, homeowners and LPAs an indication of areas, where data are available, that have potential impacts on biodiversity and are likely to be relevant to local planning decisions by applying biodiversity criteria developed by GiGL, based on the original “Planning for Biodiversity?” research. ‘Hotspot’ areas indicate a detected presence of sensitive biodiversity that could potentially be affected by development. Original records can be accessed from GiGL to assist the decision-making process.\n\nN.B. 1: Areas without these biodiversity indicator records may still have undetected biodiversity so should also be considered for biodiversity potential on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\nN.B. 2: The dataset is purely indicative and an ecological data search report must still be commissioned as evidence for planning applications. See  here  for help on this.\n\n\n\n\nSpecification\nThe GIS file shows London as 100m hexagon tiles. Each tile is scored for the known presence of protected species, sites and habitats impact areas based on the impact buffer size as specified in the criteria table below, giving a cumulative score range of 0 to 3. Tiles are considered a hotspot where impact areas overlap the tile by more than 10%.\n\n\n\nTiles with a score of 0 indicate that there are currently no known protected species, sites or habitats impact areas present in that area based on the criteria table, which excludes some protected species. Tiles with a score of 3 indicate the presence of impact areas for all three categories. Intermediate scores indicate the presence of impact areas for one or more of the categories without specifying which are present. The scores can be used in a thematic map to colour the tiles and visually indicate areas with greater presence of impact areas. A sample thematic map is provided.\nThe dataset will be updated annually using the latest protected species, sites and habitats data available to GiGL at time of creation. Please give GiGL appropriate credit when using, adapting or sharing the dataset following the guidance below:\n\nIn-text citation: GiGL, [dataset creation date]\n\nReference: \"Biodiversity Hotspots for Planning\" Greenspace Information for Greater London CIC, [dataset creation date]\n\nWhere data is used in maps: Map displays GiGL data [dataset creation date]\n\nWhere data is summarised but not mapped: Data provided by Greenspace Information for Greater London CIC [dataset creation date]",

            "summary": "London Heat Map\nThe London Heat Map is a tool designed to help you identify areas of high heat demand, explore opportunities for new and expanding district heat networks and to draw potential heat networks and assess their financial feasibility.\nThe new version of the London Heat Map was created for the Greater London Authority by the Centre for Sustainable Energy (CSE) in July 2019. The London Heat Map is regularly updated with new network data and other datasets. Background datasets such as building heat demand was last updated on 26/06/2023.\nThe London Heatmap is a map-based web application you can use to find and appraise opportunities for decentralised energy (DE) projects in London.\nThe map covers the whole of Greater London, and provides very local information to help you identify and develop DE opportunities, including data such as:\n\nHeat demand values for each building\nLocations of potential heat supply sites\nLocations of existing and proposed district heating networks\nA spatial heat demand density map layer\n\nThe map also includes a user-friendly visual tool for heat network design. This is intended to support preliminary techno-economic appraisal of potential district heat networks.\nThe London Heat Map is used by a wide variety of people in numerous ways:\n\nLondon Boroughs can use the new map to help develop their energy master plans.\nProperty developers can use the map to help them meet the decentralised energy policies in the London Plan.\nEnergy consultants can use the map to gather initial data to inform feasibility studies.\n\nMore information is available here, and an interactive map is available here.\nBuilding-level estimated annual and peak heat demand data from the London Heat Map has been made available through the data extracts below. The data was last updated on 26/06/2023. The data contains Ordnance Survey mapping and the data is published under Ordnance Survey's 'presumption to publish'. © Crown copyright and database rights 2023.\n\nThe Decentralised Energy Master planning programme (DEMaP)\nThe Decentralised Energy Master planning programme (DEMaP), was completed in October 2010. It included a heat mapping support package for the London boroughs to enable them to carry out high resolution heat mapping for their area.\nTo date, heat maps have been produced for 29 London boroughs with the remaining four boroughs carrying out their own data collection. All of the data collected through this process is provided below.\nCarbon Calculator Tool\nArup have produced a Carbon Calculator Tool to assist projects in their early estimation of the carbon dioxide (CO2) savings which could be realised by a district heating scheme with different sources of heating.\nThe calculator's estimates include the impact of a decarbonising the electrical grid over time, based on projections by the Department for Energy and Climate Change, as well as the Government's Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP).\nThe Excel-based tool can be downloaded below.\nBorough Heat Maps Data and Reports (2012)\nIn March 2012, all London boroughs did a heat mapping exercise. The data from this includes the following and can be downloaded below:\n\nHeat Load for all boroughs\nHeat Supplies for all boroughs\nHeat Network\nLDD 2010 database\nComplete GIS London Heat Map Data\n\nThe heat maps contain real heat consumption data for priority buildings such as hospitals, leisure centres and local authority buildings.\nAs part of this work, each of the boroughs developed implementation plans to help them take the DE opportunities identified to the next stages. The implementation plans include barriers and opportunities, actions to be taken by the council, key dates, personnel responsible. These can be downloaded below.\nOther Useful Documents\nOther useful documents can be downloaded from the links below:\n\nEnergy Masterplanning Manual \n\n\nOpportunities for Decentralised Energy in London - Vision Map\n\n\nLondon Heat Network Manual\n\n\nLondon Heat Network Manual II\n",
