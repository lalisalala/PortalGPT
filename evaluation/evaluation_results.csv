1. **Title:** COVID-19 Restrictions Timeseries
**Summary:** This dataset contains information about various COVID-19 restrictions and policies in London, UK. It includes details about school closures, pub closures, shop closures, stay-at-home orders, and more. Although the dataset does not specify a time period, it is provided for context analysis with other social or economic datasets such as footfall and spend data timeseries. This dataset might be useful if you're interested in understanding the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on different aspects of society.

2. **Title:** Entertainment Licensing
**Summary:** This dataset provides modelled estimates of entertainment-licensed premises in Greater London, including premises licenses and club premises certificates. Although the data publisher is discontinued, it falls under the scope of the Night Time Observatory. The data format is a spreadsheet, with unknown time coverage. This dataset could be valuable if you're interested in analyzing entertainment licensing trends over time.

3. **Title:** Number of Premises Licences and Club Premises Certificates
**Summary:** This dataset provides the number of active Premises Licences and Club Premises Certificates in England and Wales related to alcohol, entertainment, and late-night refreshment sales. The data covers on and off sales, sporting events, live music, and recorded music. This dataset could be useful if you're investigating licensing trends for various types of businesses over time.

4. **Title:** Alcohol and late-night refreshment licensing statistics
**Summary:** This dataset, published by the Greater London Authority (GLA), provides statistics on licensed premises with alcohol status and population density for individuals aged 18 and over, per licensing authority. The data is not available for 2015. It forms part of the GLA's Night Time Observatory. This dataset could be useful if you're interested in analyzing the distribution of licensed premises with alcohol status across different areas.

**Dataset 1 - GLA cost of living polling**
This dataset provides insights into public attitudes and behaviors towards the cost of living in London, including potential impacts on household budgets. The data is based on surveys conducted online by YouGov Plc and weighted to be representative of all London adults aged 18+. It may not directly address food expenditure, but it can give you an idea about how Londoners perceive their overall living costs and budget allocation.

**Dataset 2 - Survey of Londoners 2021-22**
This survey assessed the impact of COVID-19 on Londoners, including potential changes in household budgets due to the pandemic's effects on the cost of living. While it may not specifically address food expenditure, it can provide some insights into how Londoners have managed their finances over the past year or so.

**Dataset 5 - The Rising Cost of Living and Access to Adult Education in London**
Although this report focuses mainly on the impact of rising living costs on adult education in London, it does highlight that 17% of Londoners are struggling financially, which can indirectly suggest potential changes in their household budget allocation. However, please note that this data is from November 2023 to March 2024, slightly outside the specified time range (2022 or 2023).

If a more direct dataset on food expenditure as a percentage of the budget among adults in recent years were available, I would suggest it first.

Here are some recommendations:

1. **London's Population**: This dataset provides the most recent mid-year estimate for London's population and includes factors influencing its growth such as births, deaths, and international migration. It is expected to be updated in July 2025.

2. **Birth Estimates**: This time series data offers live births in England and Wales from 1991-92 to the present, which can provide insights into population growth trends over time. The data is sourced from official sources like ONS mid-year population estimates and monthly births by local authority.

3. **Population Change 1939-2015**: This dataset provides borough population estimates and projections (1939-2039) in an Excel workbook, highlighting London's population exceeding 8.6 million people in 2015. It is a comprehensive resource for understanding long-term population trends in London.

If you're looking for the ""best"" dataset, I would recommend considering both the **London's Population** and **Birth Estimates** datasets. The London's Population dataset provides more recent data and insights into current factors influencing London's population growth, while the Birth Estimates dataset offers a time series analysis of live births in England and Wales over several decades, which can help identify trends and patterns in population growth.

1. **Accessibility of London Underground Stations**: This dataset is detailed and specific to the London Underground Stations, containing information on physical accessibility such as walking distances, number of stairs, and location of amenities. While the data requires further processing, it could be particularly useful if you are looking for London-specific data.

2. **TfL Station Facilities**: This dataset provides detailed information about facilities and access for various train stations in London, including details on station amenities marked with the TfL roundel. Although the format remains unknown, the topic of accessibility is a central aspect of this dataset.

3. **Train Station Usage**: This dataset offers historical estimates of train station usage figures in the UK, covering various rail networks like Network Rail and London Overground. While it does not specifically focus on step-free access, it could still provide valuable insights into the overall usage patterns at different stations.

4. **TfL Rolling Origin and Destination Survey (RODS)**: The TfL RODS program provides detailed data about journeys on the London Underground network, including boardings/alightings, line loading, station flows, origin-destination matrices, access/egress modes, etc. Although it does not focus solely on step-free access, it offers a broad understanding of how people move through train stations, which could be beneficial for your research.

If you are looking for the ""best"" dataset, I would recommend the **Accessibility of London Underground Stations** dataset since it directly addresses the issue of physical accessibility at train stations, and it is specific to the London Underground network, which might be particularly relevant to your study.

Here are some recommendations:

1. **Dataset 1: COVID-19 Restrictions Timeseries**
   This dataset provides a time-series of various COVID-19 restrictions and policies in London, UK. It could be useful for research related to the impact of such measures on different aspects like social or economic behavior.

2. **Dataset 2: GiGL Spaces to Visit**
   While this dataset primarily focuses on open spaces in Greater London, it is still relevant as it provides information on publically accessible areas suitable for leisure activities. This could potentially be used in research examining the effect of restrictions on public spaces usage.

3. **Dataset 3: London Borough of Southwark waiting, stopping, and loading restrictions**
   This dataset offers insights into highway restrictions maintained by Southwark. Although it doesn't directly relate to licensing restrictions, understanding traffic regulations can contribute to research involving transportation or urban planning.

4. **Dataset 5: Entertainment licensing (if available)**
   If accessible and its time coverage is relevant, this dataset provides modelled estimates of premises licenses and club certificates for regulated entertainment within Greater London's Night Time Observatory.

1. **London Datastore Catalogue**: This dataset provides a live snapshot of all metadata entries on the London Datastore, making it relevant for those seeking metadata information. It is available in various formats and includes tags like 'metadata' and 'datastore'. However, please note that the exact time coverage is unknown.

2. **GiGL Spaces to Visit**: While not explicitly a metadata dataset, the GiGL Spaces to Visit dataset provides public access information for open spaces in Greater London. It could potentially include documentation about these spaces. The data is updated quarterly and covers various types of open spaces like parks and nature reserves.

3. **City Tools: London**: This dataset provides information about IT systems, contracts, and suppliers utilized across various London boroughs. Although not directly related to the metadata you're seeking, it does contain documentation on a large scale system, which might include metadata. The data is available in HTML and CSV formats and covers 809 systems.

Since all three datasets are relevant in different ways, I would suggest starting with the London Datastore Catalogue due to its specific focus on metadata.
